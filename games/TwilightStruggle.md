# Twilight Struggle

- Wargame / World domination game
- 2 players
- 3h

## Intro

It's the cold war. USA and USSR try to influence and control countries, reach the moon, and avoid a nuclear war.

## Setup

## Turn

- Draw cards
  - USSR draws first card, then the players alternate

## End

## Notes

- The optional cards are recommended for balance
- When a card lets you move influence points, no restrictions apply (no need for neighboring influence, no penalty if opponent controls the country). That is not the same as receiving/using Operations Points.
- Quagmire (Atoleiro) makes you discard **instead** of playing a card.
