# Daggerheart

## Abilities

- Each character has a loadout of cards with abilities (5 max).
- Each ability has a switch cost (in *Stress*) that you can pay to replace a card in your loadout.
- Each ability can cost *Hope*, *Stress* or even a roleplay requirement (e.g. compliment someone on something and each gains 3 *Hope*; tell the target something about yourself and you heal more).
