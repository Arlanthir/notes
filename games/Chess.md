Rows are called ranks. First rank is the nearest to the player.  
Columns are called files.

## Opening principles

- Seize the center of the board: your pieces will have more possible moves.
- Knights before bishops. Knights need more steps and its more obvious where they are needed in the beginning of the game.
- Develop your pieces (not pawns) quickly and once per piece.
- The f pawns are vulnerable because they are only guarded by the King.
- Castle early, preferably on the kingside.
- Keep the pawns protecting the King after castle in their initial positions. Never try to prevent a pin by advancing a pawn before it happens.
- Use a minor piece (usually a Knight) in conjunction with the 3 pawns to protect a castle.
- Develop pieces before initiating combinations (sequence of moves, often initiated by a sacrifice, which leaves the opponent few options and results in tangible gain).
