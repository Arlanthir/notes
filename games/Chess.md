Rows are called ranks. First rank is the nearest to the player.  
Columns are called files.

## Opening principles

- Seize the center of the board: your pieces will have more possible moves.
- Knights before bishops. Knights need more steps and its more obvious where they are needed in the beginning of the game.
- Develop your pieces (not pawns) quickly and once per piece.
- The f pawns are vulnerable because they are only guarded by the King.
- Castle early, preferably on the kingside.
- Keep the pawns protecting the King after castle in their initial positions. Avoid trying to prevent a pin by advancing a pawn before it happens.
- Use a minor piece (usually a Knight) in conjunction with the 3 pawns to protect a castle.
- Develop pieces before initiating combinations (sequence of moves, often initiated by a sacrifice, which leaves the opponent few options and results in tangible gain).
- A bishop is best placed for attack controlling a diagonal that crosses the center, or pinning a Knight.
- Defensively, a bishop in the second rank is fine.
- When choosing a pawn to capture with, generally capture towards the center to open files for your rooks.
- An early open Queen is generally bad, because of Knight developing with tempo on the f file and attacking the Queen.

#### [Accelerated Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Accelerated_Dragon)

Good videos:

The Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense fianchettoes the kingside bishop to control the center from afar.
Because it wastes a move playing **d6**, it allows White to castle queenside and unleash a kingside pawn storm.
The **Accelerated** Dragon variation's objective is to save a *tempo* and threaten to play **d5** in one go, disarming White's pawn storm by opening up the center and sometimes forcing White to castle kingside due to tactics.

2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4 cxd4
4. Nxd4 g6 (D)

![](http://www.fen-to-image.com/image/30/single/coords/r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R)

##### Main line

White continues development, paying special attention to black's threatened Ng4 (attacking the bishop).
Other Black tactics include taking the **e4** pawn while attacking a **d2** queen with the knight, discovering the fianchetto'd bishop's attack on the knight.
It usually also protects the other bishop, dropping it to **b3**.

5. Nc3 Bg7
6. Be3 Nf6
7. Bc4 (D)

![](http://www.fen-to-image.com/image/30/single/coords/r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R)

Usually:

7. ... 0-0
8. Bb3 (D)

![](http://www.fen-to-image.com/image/30/single/coords/r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R)

Note that **8.f3** (like in the Dragon variation) would not be a good choice because **8...Qb6** allow tactics that win a pawn or more.

**8.Qd2** is also not good because **8...Ng4** often results in an endgame where Black has a positional advantage.

Now after **8.Bb3**, if Black plays **8...d6**, the position transposes to the normal Dragon variation, in which White plays **9.f3**, castles queenside and unleashes the pawn storm in the kingside, but if Black plays **8...a5** or **8...Qa5**, castling queenside becomes dangerous for White.

##### Maróczy Bind

Good video:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MONK6rQuido

Because Black doesn't threaten the e pawn with 4...Nf6, White can freely occupy one more square in the center, cramping Black's position.
This translates into a more positional game.

5. c4 (D)

![](http://www.fen-to-image.com/image/30/single/coords/r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R)

Often:

5. ... Bg7
6. Be3 Nf6
7. Nc3 0-0
8. Be2 d6

### [King's Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Gambit)

White offers a pawn to induce Black into surrendering his share of the center.

![](http://www.fen-to-image.com/image/30/single/coords/rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR)

### [Colle System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_System)

Open with d4, stack attacks on e4 and unleash them all with a pawn push. The objective is to remove the black Knight guarding h7 and make a kingside attack.

One interesting detail is White's knight on d2.
