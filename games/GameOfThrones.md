# Game of Thrones (second edition)

- Area control game
- 3-6 players (best 6, 3 not recommended)
- 2-4h

## Intro

Each player is one of the Houses of Westeros, trying to claim the Iron Throne.

## Setup

1. Each House places their cards, tokens and units on the board according to their player screens.
2. Each House places their Victory, Supply and Influence tokens on the board.

## Turns

### Planning phase

- Each player places one order token in each area containing one of their units.
  - Units: Footmen, Knights, Ships and Siege Engines.
  - Orders: March, Defense, Support, Raid, Consolidate Power.
- Reveal all orders simultaneously.

### Action phase

1. The House that controls the Messenger Raven (highest influence in King's Court) may:  
   - Change one of their assigned orders to an unused order; OR
   - Look at the top Wildling deck card
2. Order resolution:
   1. Raid (in Iron Throne influence order)  
      - Remove Support, Consolidate Power or Raid orders 
   2. March (in Iron Throne influence order)  
      - Move units to adjacent spaces  
      - Ships form bridges between two land spaces
      - Can choose to spend a Control token to maintain control of areas that they are leaving
      - Moving to a space occupied by another player results in combat:
        - Support from units in adjacent areas with Support orders
        - Unit strength: Footmen/Ship = 1, Knight = 2, Siege Engine = 4 (vs Castle/Stronghold)
        - Possible bonus from March and/or Defense orders
        - Each House reveals a House card
        - If a House controls the Valyrian Steel Blade (highest influence in the Fiefdoms), it can add +1 Strength to a combat per round.
        - Defeated units retreat to adjacent empty/friendly areas and become routed (sideways, cannot provide strength this turn)
      - A player resolves only one of his orders before passing to the next, cycling back until all orders are resolved.
   3. Consolidate Power (in Iron Throne influence order)
      - Gain 1 Power token + bonus Power symbols in the area
   4. Remove Defense and Support tokens
   5. Restore routed units
   6. Advance the Round marker on the track

### Beginning of next round (after the first)

1. Reveal 1 from each Westeros deck
   - Mustering
   - Supply
   - Influence
   - Wildlings

## End

- If at any point a player controls 7 Castles/Strongholds, they win
- After 10 rounds, the player who controls more Castles and Strongholds wins
