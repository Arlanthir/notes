# Star Realms

- Deckbuilding game
- 2 players (1-4 players with Frontiers)
- 20 min

## Intro

Each player controls a space armada of multiple factions to destroy their opponent.


## Setup

- Deck of 8 Scout + 2 Viper to each player (Personal Deck) and shuffle them
- Each player has 50 Authority (green shield icons, life points)
- Shuffle Trade Deck, place it on the table
- Deal 5 cards from the Trade Deck to the table (it's the Trade Row)
- 16 Explorer cards face-up next to the Trade Row
- The first player draws 3 cards
- The second player draws 5 cards

## Turn

### Main Phase

Do any of the following, as many times as you like, in any order:

- Play cards from hand
  - Place them in front of you
  - If they are Ships, their Primary Ability triggers
- Use Primary Abilities of in-play Bases
- Use Ally/Scrap Abilities of cards
  - Ally Abilities need a ship of a certain Faction (color) to be used (typically the same one)
  - Scrap Abilities (trash can icon) make you place the card in the Scrap Pile (near the Trade Deck)
- Buy cards from Trade Row / Explorers
  - Spend Trade points (gold coin icons)
  - Place the card in your Discard Pile
  - If you buy a card from the Trade Row, immediately replace it with a new card from the Trade Deck
- Use combat to attack the opponent (or their Bases)
  - Spend Combat points (red target icons)
  - You must destroy Outputs (Bases with black shield) before attacking/targetting other Bases or the opponent
  - To destroy a Base, deal damage equal to their Defense in a single turn

### Discard Phase

- Lose any remaining Trade or Combat points
- Discard all played ships (Bases remain in play)
- Discard your remaining hand


### Draw Phase

- Draw 5 cards


## End

Game ends when a player reaches 0 Authority (life points). The other one is the winner.


## Solo / Co-op Variant

Use the oversized Challenge cards as a Boss. Also read the Challenge's specific rules (and story) in the manual.

Set the difficulty:

1. Players take three turns each before the Boss's first turn
2. Players take two turns each before the Boss's first turn
3. Players take one turn each before the Boss's first turn
4. The Boss goes first

Once per game, the active player can mulligan the entire Trade Row and replace it with new cards from the Trade Deck.

- When Bosses have a hand, they get their normal hand size even when going first.
- When Players play first, they get 3 cards each instead of 5 in their starting hands.
- When the Boss plays an ability among multiple, it chooses the ability with the highest cost.
- If the Trade Deck runs out, reshuffle the Trade cards in the Scrap Pile into a new Trade Deck.

When Boss attacks, it chooses in order:

1. If it can defeat a Player, it defeats the Player with the highest Authority it can.
2. If it can destroy an Outpost, it destroys the one with the highest Defense it can. In case of ties, it chooses the one with highest cost.
3. If it can destroy a Base, it destroys the one with the highest Defense it can. In case of ties, it chooses the one with highest cost.
4. The Boss attacks the Player with lowest Authority. If tied, choose one of them at random.

## Notes

- Whenever you need to draw and have no more cards, shuffle your Discard Pile and it becomes your new deck.
- Remember that played Ships only go to your Discard Pile in the Discard Phase, but cards you buy from the Trade Row go immediately.
- When you Scrap an Explorer, place it in the Explorer Pile again.
