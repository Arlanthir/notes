## Intro

Each player controls a Viking clan in its quest for Glory.

Glory is achieved through quests, battle and death!

## Setup

Each player:
1. Take a clan sheet.
2. Take the corresponding army (1 leader, 8 warriors, 1 ship).
3. Place the **Glory** (score) token of your color in the 0 spot in the edge of the board.
4. Place 1 clan token in each sheet stat's (**Rage**, **Axes**, **Horns**) leftmost value.
5. Place a token in the **Rage** tracker in the value dictated by your **Rage** stat (starting should be 6).

Board:
1. Place the green pillage token face up in the center of the board (Yggdrasil).
2. Randomly place the other pillage tokens face up in each province.
3. Choose 3 random Ragnarok tokens, one for each age, and place them face up.
4. Depending on the number of players, remove X (4 players = 1 province, 3=2, 2=3) random provinces from the game using their Ragnarok tokens with the destroyed side face up.
5. Place the Doom token in the next province to be destroyed (in the first age).

Cards:
1. Remove/add cards depending on the number of players (3+/4+/5).
2. (Optional) add/remove the Mystic Expansion cards for each age.
   - If you add the Mystic Expansion cards, give a Mystic unit reference card (green back) to each player. They do not yet have the Mystics in their reserve.
3. Separate cards by their age (back): 1, 2, 3.
4. Shuffle each pile and place it in the corresponding age.

Choose a player to be the starting player and give them the First Player token.
