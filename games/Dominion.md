Next player in clockwise order.

## End

- When the Province pile is empty **or** any other 3 Supply piles are empty.
- The player with the most Victory Points (given by Estate, Duchy, Province, Gardens, ...) in their deck wins the game.
- If players are tied, the one that took the fewest turns wins. If they're still tied, it's a draw between them.

## Notes

- Players can't go through their Discard pile
- When an effect affects multiple players, it does so in turn order.
