## Intro

You are a painter trying to create masterpieces.

## Setup

1. Place (up to) 4 random Scoring Cards on top of the mat (board).  
   Recommended scenarios:
   - **First time**: Variety, Repetition, Emphasis, Composition
   - **Balanced** (2 cards with elements, 2 cards without): Consistency, Emphasis, Hierarchy, Proportion
   - **No elements**: Composition, Consistency, Proportion, Symmetry
   - **Simplified - Chill**: only 3 random scoring cards
   - **Simplified - Synergy**: Proximity, Space, Variety
   - **Simplified - Family**: Composition, Variety
   - **Complex - All Elements**: Emphasis, Hierarchy, Repetition, Style
   - **Complex - Bonus**: Hierarchy, Movement, Proportion, Style
   - **Complex - Spatial**: Movement, Proximity, Space, Symmetry
2. Place the Ribbon Tokens next to the matching icons on the mat.
3. Shuffle the transparent Art Cards and place them inside the deck box, on the deck space. Draw 5 and place them on the spaces on the left.
4. Each player takes 3 sleeved Background Cards.
5. Each player takes 4 Inspiration Tokens (palettes)

## Turn

Choose **one** action:
- Take an Art Card
  - You can only have 5 cards in hand.
  - You may take the leftmost one for free.
  - To take any other card instead, you must place an Inspiration Token on each card to the left of it.
  - You gain all Inspiration Tokens that were already placed on your chosen card.
  - After taking a card, advance all the remaining ones to the left and draw a new one onto the rightmost space.
- Complete a Painting
  - Select exactly 3 cards from your hand.
  - Layer them in any order you like (to score the most points).
  - Place them with the sleeved Background.
  - Show it and read its title out loud.
  - Gain Ribbons based on the Scoring Cards (clarifications on the back of each Scoring Card)
  - Gain Ribbons based on the Bonus Icons on the painting (<Gray Bonus Ribbon> **PER** <Element>).

## End

Game ends when all players have completed 3 paintings. (Players that complete the paintings first stop playing and just wait for the others.)

- Each player receives points according to the Scoring Card Ribbon counts.
- Each player receives 2 points per (Gray) Bonus Ribbon.
- Player with the most points wins!
- When tied, player with the most Inspiration Tokens left wins.
- When still tied, have someone judge the artwork of the paintings to find the winner!

## Solo Variants

### Painting with Vincent

- Imaginary player Vincent starts with 4 Inspiration Tokens as well.
- Vincent never completes paintings.
- You take the first turn.
- On Vincent's turn, shake and throw his Inspiration Tokens, the ones which fall face-up are spent to skip Art Cards.
  Vincent takes the resulting Art Card (remove it from the game) and gains any Inspiration Tokens on it.
- Remember Vincent still takes a turn when you complete a painting.

### Solo Puzzle

- Start with 4 Inspiration Tokens as usual.
- Create an additional Supply of 4 Inspiration Tokens next to the Art Cards.
- Instead of placing spent Inspiration Tokens on Art Cards, place them in the Supply.
- Skipped cards are removed from the game. Draw that many Art Cards from the deck and slide everything to the left as usual.
- Gain 1 Inspiration from the Supply when you take the leftmost Art Card.
- Gain 1 Inspiration from the Supply when you complete a painting.
