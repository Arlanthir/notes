# Docker

Docker allows developers to wrap software and dependencies, building images that can be instantiated, running in isolated containers.  
This means self-configured software that always runs, not only "on my machine".

## Searching for images

Browse and search via browser in https://hub.docker.com/ or use the following command:

```bash
docker search <name>
```
