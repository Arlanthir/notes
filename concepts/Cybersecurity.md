# Cybersecurity

## Introduction

The goal of cybersecurity is to protect the **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability** of *assets*.

- **Confidentiality**: Information is only available to those who should have access (e.g. by encription).
- **Integrity**: Data is known to be correct and trusted (e.g. by hashes).
- **Availability**: Information is available for use by legitimate users when it is needed (e.g. by redundancy).

**Asset** is anything that either:
- Holds value (e.g. data, protected by maintaining its integrity).
- Produces value (e.g. server, protected by maintaining its availability).
- Provides access to value (e.g. password, protected by maintaining its confidentiality).

**Threats**:
- **Vulnerability**: weakness that makes an asset susceptible to attack or failure.
- **Attack**: intentional action to reduce the value of an asset.
- **Failure**: unintentional action that can reduce the value of an asset.
