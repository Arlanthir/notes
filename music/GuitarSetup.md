Correct order of the setup:
1. Restring
2. Truss Rod
3. Bridge Angle
4. String Action
5. Intonation

### Restring

One string at a time or all strings at once by blocking the tremolo with a wooden block (before even removing the old ones).  
Lubricate the nut with a graphite pencil.

After passing the string through the peg hole:
- Pull it fairly tout
- Measure another two pegs (and a bit) after it with your finger (aim for three complete wraps of the string around the peg)
  - For smaller pegs (like staggered pegs on a Stratocaster, go for two complete wraps: measure just a peg and a half worth of length)
- Pull the string back until your measuring finger returns to the peg hole
- Bend the string upwards to mark it with a kink
- Pull it again just 0.5cm, to move the kink out of the hole (easier to cut afterwards)
- Start rolling it underneath
- Cut the string

Remember to stretch the strings (by pulling them off the fretboard across the entire fretboard) and remove the wooden block before tuning.

I usually buy Nickel wound strings with gauges: 10 13 17 26 36 46.

### Remove rust from frets

Use 0000 Steel wool or toothpaste. Make sure to cover the fretboard (except the frets) with tape or a cutout card, and also cover the pickups (magnets will attract steel wool).  
Another trick mentioned is using pencil eraser, might be worth it to try.

### Tuning

1. Adjust the fine tuners to the middle of each.
2. Unlock the screws in the locking nut.
3. Tune each string in playing position (not laying on the table).
   Tuning order: Low E (6), High E (1), B (2), A (5), G (3), D (4).  
   Remember to tune up to pitch instead of down, so make sure to drop a bit below tune before moving slowly up.  
   Repeat this until it's tuned.
4. Lock the locking nut screws.
5. Retune with the fine tuners.

When tuning to Drop C (D Drop C) or below, a string gauge of 10 or above is recommended.

### Truss Rod

Truss rod adjustment is needed when you change to a different string gauge or whenever you feel the neck is bowing too much or too little.  
Tightening the truss rod decreases neck relief.  
You should only screw/unscrew the truss rod in increments of about 2 hours on a clock (60º) between measurements.  
Adjustments to the truss rod take about 10 minutes to have an effect, so don't check string buzzing immediately after adjusting.

To measure the neck relief, put a capo on the first fret, fret the last one and measure (with a feeler gauge) the height from the middle fret (around 8th) to the 6th string.  
The recommended Fender/Squier neck relief is 0.010'', or 0.25mm. Generally, anything between 0.008'' (0.20mm, good starting point if unsure of playing style) to 0.012'' (0.30mm) is good.


### String Action

Loosen the strings before changing string action, retune them afterwards to check the final height.

String action = string height at the 12th fret.

When strings are too low and you bend a string, the other strings get under your finger.  
When strings are too high and you bend a string, the other strings get over your finger.

On Fender-style guitars, you have to measure the neck radius with a radius tool.  
The Squier Showmaster (Stagemaster) should have a 12.6'' radius.  
To check if the strings curvature matches the neck curvature, rest the radius tool on the strings with the correct side and verify that all are muted. If it doesn't match, you need to adjust individual string height.

#### Typical string action

| String              | Inches | Mm    |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Low E (6th string)  | 4/64'' | 1.6mm |
| High E (1st string) | 3/64'' | 1.2mm |


### Intonation

Intonation is basically scale length compensation. To make sure the frets align with the correct notes (not flat and not sharp), you shorten or lengthen the length of the string and therefore the scale.

Intonation is the last thing to do on a setup because it is affected by all other processes but doesn't affect them.

To check the intonation of each string (most accurate in playing position):
- Tune it to pitch
- Play it open
- Play it on the 12th fret (aim for the middle of the fret, with the same attack that you used in the open string pluck), should be in tune with the same note
- If it was flat, reduce string length (loosen the screw)
- If it was sharp, increase string length (tighten the screw)
- Retune and retest

## Classical

### Restring

Start with the treble (thin) strings. They need more time to stretch.

Put the string through the hole in the bridge and make a knot wrapping the bridge, looping the string two/three times onto itself.  
The end of the string should be pulled to fit behind the bridge, pointing to the middle of the guitar (the D/G strings), optionally being held by the string next to it.

After pulling the string through the hole in each peg, knot it as well. It may help to loop the string to the side contrary to what you want to wrap it afterwards.

When wrapping the string around the tuning peg, the outer strings (High E and Low E) should wrap towards the outside of the guitar. The inner 4 strings should wrap to the inside of the guitar.
