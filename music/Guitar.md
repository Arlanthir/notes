## Tunings

### Standard tuning

EADGBE

### Drop C tuning (D Drop C)

Everything is one note lower, except the 6th string which is another note lower.

CGCFAD

## Tuning without a tuner

For both these methods you should first tune your 6th string (the thickest) to a reference note or a tuner if possible.
Otherwise, your guitar will be in tune with itself but not with others.

### String notes

- 6th string, 5th fret = 5th string, open
- 5th string, 5th fret = 4th string, open
- 4th string, 5th fret = 3rd string, open
- 3rd string, 4th fret = 2nd string, open
- 2nd string, 5th fret = 1st string, open

### Harmonics

- 6th string, 5th harmonic = 5th string, 7th harmonic
- 5th string, 5th harmonic = 4th string, 7th harmonic
- 4th string, 5th harmonic = 3rd string, 7th harmonic
- 6th string, 7th harmonic = 2nd string, open = 2nd string, 12th harmonic
- 6th string, 5th harmonic = 1st string, open
