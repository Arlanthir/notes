# Floyd Rose

## Setup

Correct order of the setup:
1. Restring
2. Truss Rod
3. Bridge Angle
4. String Action
5. Intonation

## Restring

One string at a time or all strings at once by blocking the tremolo with a wooden block.


## Remove rust from frets

Use 0000 Steel wool or toothpaste. Make sure to cover the fretboard (except the frets) and the pickups (magnets will attract steel wool).
Another trick mentioned is using pencil eraser, might be worth it to try.
