# Floyd Rose

## Setup

Correct order of the setup:
1. Restring
2. Truss Rod
3. Bridge Angle
4. String Action
5. Intonation

## Restring

One string at a time or all strings at once by blocking the tremolo with a wooden block (before even removing the old ones).  
Lubricate the nut with a graphite pencil.  
Remember to stretch the strings (by pulling them off the fretboard across the entire fretboard) and remove the wooden block before tuning.

I usually buy Nickel wound strings with gauges: 10 13 17 26 36 46.

## Remove rust from frets

Use 0000 Steel wool or toothpaste. Make sure to cover the fretboard (except the frets) and the pickups (magnets will attract steel wool).
Another trick mentioned is using pencil eraser, might be worth it to try.

## Tuning

1. Adjust the fine tuners to the middle of each.
2. Unlock the screws in the locking nut.
3. Tune each string in playing position (not laying on the table).
   Tuning order: Low E (6), High E (1), B (2), A (5), G (3), D (4).  
   Remember to tune up to pitch instead of down, so make sure to drop a bit below tune before moving slowly up.  
   Repeat this until it's tuned.
4. Lock the locking nut screws.
5. Retune with the fine tuners.

When tuning to Drop C (D Drop C) or below, a string gauge of 10 or above is recommended.

## Truss Rod

Truss rod adjustment is needed when you change to a different string gauge or whenever you feel the neck is bowing too much or too little.  
Tightening the truss rod decreases neck relief.  
You should only screw/unscrew the truss rod in increments of about 2 hours on a clock (60ยบ) between measurements.  
Adjustments to the truss rod take about 10 minutes to have an effect, so don't check string buzzing immediately after adjusting.

To measure the neck relief, put a capo on the first fret, fret the last one and measure (with a feeler gauge) the height from the middle fret (around 8th) to the 6th string.  
The recommended Fender/Squier neck relief is 0.010'', or 0.25mm.


## String Action

Loosen the strings before changing string action, retune them afterwards to check the final height.

### Typical string action

| String              | Inches | Mm    |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Low E (6th string)  | 4/64'' | 1.6mm |
| High E (1st string) | 3/64'' | 1.2mm |
