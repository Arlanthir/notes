## The Note Circle

As taught by Justin Sandercoe from http://www.justinguitar.com.  
Each step along the circle is a semitone, and a fret on the guitar.

Notice how B and E don't have sharps before the next note.

## Scale

### Major Scale

To construct a major scale, choose a root note and the following notes: WWHWWWH (W: whole tone, H: semitone). Each note in a scale is given a number 1-7 and written as a roman numeral in order to symbolize major chords as uppercase and minor chords as lowercase.

E.g. for C Major:

| Note            | **C** | D  | E   | F  | G | A  | B                 |
| --------------- | ----- | -- | --- | -- | - | -- | ----------------- |
| Number in scale | 1     | 2  | 3   | 4  | 5 | 6  | 7                 |
| Major/minor     | I     | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | viiÂº (diminished) |


#### Diatonic chords

Chords in the same notes of the scale are called Diatonic Chords. A good rule of thumb for chord progressions using those chords:
- Start with the root note chord (I)
- End with a IV or V chord

## Time Signatures

Time signatures define the essential rhythm of the song. The first beat of the bar is the **downbeat** and generally denotes a more powerful sound. The **upbeat** is the beat that precedes the downbeat.

- 4/4: Four beats per measure (bar; *compasso*)
- 3/4: Three beats per measure (waltz)
- 2/4: Two beats per measure (march)
- 6/8: Like waltz, but the 4th beat is not as strong as the first
