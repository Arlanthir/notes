# Card Magic

## Important terms

- **Overhand shuffle**: Shuffling by grabbing bottom portion of deck with right hand, progressively putting cards from the top of the right pile to the left.
- **Run**: While performing an overhand shuffle, take cards one by one from the right pile to the top of the left pile using the left thumb.
- **Injog**: While running cards, move the right hand closer to the body so the drawn card is shifted towards you.
- **Outjog**: Same as injog, but the card protrudes away from you.
- **Riffle shuffle**: The usual gamers' shuffle that riffles two halves of the deck together.
- **Pinky break**: Hold the left pinky between top and bottom pack to keep the position and later do a sleight (like a cut, etc).

## Sleights

### Overhand shuffle

#### Control the top card

1. Use left thumb to grab onto top card while right hand takes the rest of deck.
2. Overhand shuffle as normal. Card is now on the bottom.
3. Overhand shuffle while running the last few cards until only the one remains.

#### Control the bottom card

1. Apply pressure with the left fingers to keep bottom card while grabbing the portion to really shuffle.
2. Overhand shuffle as usual. Bottom card remains.

#### Retain top and bottom

1. Apply pressure with left thumb and fingers so the top and bottom cards remain and the rest of the deck is overhand shuffled.
2. The previous top card is now second from the bottom. The bottom card is retained.
3. Overhand shuffle while running the last few cards until only the one remains. Top and bottom cards are now in the original position.

#### Undercut

1. While overhanding shuffling, injog the first card.
2. Shuffle the other cards as normal, injogging some cards to distract from the first injog.
3. After the shuffle, grab the deck from below the injogged card and cut it onto the top of the left pack.
4. The top cards are retained.

Optionally run some cards before injogging to put that number of cards on top of the previous top card. E.g. run 1 card before injogging to place a single card on top, preparing a later double lift.

#### Overhand false shuffle

1. Begin the overhand shuffle.
2. Run 5 cards.
3. Drop the rest of the pack on top, outjogged.
4. Grab the bottom pack, run 5 cards.
5. Drop the rest of the pack on top.

The deck remains in the original position.

### Riffle shuffle

- To retain the top cards during a riffle shuffle, make sure the hand with the top half of the deck finishes last.
- To retain the bottom cards during a riffle shuffle, make sure you start with the hand that has the bottom half of the deck.

### Elmsley count

Way of counting cards to make them appear more than the number they really are.

1. Take (e.g.) 4 cards in the left hand.
2. Push the top card with the thumb, grab the bottom 3 with the right hand, while counting "one".
3. Take the 3 cards and slide them on top of the left one.
4. Grab the previously drawn card with the right fingers to the bottom of the pack.
5. Slide off the top card with the left thumb while counting "two".
6. Count off the remaining 3 cards normally without grabbing the previous one.

### Glide

While holding the deck facedown but with the left hand on top, use the ring finger to slide the facecard backwards so you can bottom deal the second to last (and so on).

### Peek

#### 

### Double lift

Lifting the top two cards while appearing to just be showing the top card.

Usually has two phases:

1. The *get-ready*: usually catching a pinky break on the top two cards.
2. The *turnover*: the actual turn of the top two cards.
