# Card Magic

# Rules

1. The _patter_, story and personality of each performance is what makes it enjoyable and memorable.
2. Never announce your intention until all preliminary actions which make it possible are completed.
3. Never repeat a trick without replicating it by a different method.
4. Think of the sleights as *your safety net in case the misdirection goes wrong*.
5. Don't run when you're not being chased: don't overjustify regular things that the audience has not reason to suspect (yet).


# Important terms

- **Run**: While performing an overhand shuffle, take cards one by one from the right pile to the top of the left pile using the left thumb.
- **Injog**: While running cards, move the right hand closer to the body so the drawn card is shifted towards you.
- **Outjog**: Same as injog, but the card protrudes away from you.
- **Pinky break**: Hold the left pinky between top and bottom packets to keep the position and later do a sleight (like a cut, etc).. You should then square the deck and switch the pinky break from being between packets to just pressed against the gap.
- **Biddle grip**: Hold the deck with the hand above it, thumb to one side and fingers to the other.
- **Onbeat**: During the performance of a trick, while the audience is invested and with full attention.
- **Offbeat**: While the audience thinks the trick is finished, and the attention dwindles.


# Shuffles

## Overhand shuffle

Shuffling by grabbing bottom portion of deck with right hand, progressively putting cards from the top of the right pile to the left.

### Control the top card

1. Use left thumb to grab onto top card while right hand takes the rest of deck.
2. Overhand shuffle as normal. Card is now on the bottom.
3. Overhand shuffle while running the last few cards until only the one remains.

### Control the bottom card

1. Apply pressure with the left fingers to keep bottom card while grabbing the portion to really shuffle.
2. Overhand shuffle as usual. Bottom card remains.

### Retain top and bottom

1. Apply pressure with left thumb and fingers so the top and bottom cards remain and the rest of the deck is overhand shuffled.
2. The previous top card is now second from the bottom. The bottom card is retained.
3. Overhand shuffle while running the last few cards until only the one remains. Top and bottom cards are now in the original position.

### Undercut (retain top stock)

1. While overhanding shuffling, injog the first card.
2. Shuffle the other cards as normal, injogging some cards to distract from the first injog.
3. After the shuffle, grab the deck from below the injogged card and cut it onto the top of the left pack.
4. The top cards are retained.

Optionally run some cards before injogging to put that number of cards on top of the previous top card. E.g. run 1 card before injogging to place a single card on top, preparing a later double lift.

### Overhand false shuffle

1. Begin the overhand shuffle.
2. Run 5 cards.
3. Drop the rest of the pack on top, outjogged.
4. Grab the bottom pack, run 5 cards.
5. Drop the rest of the pack on top.

The deck remains in the original position.

### Overhand lift shuffle

Maintains top stock without seeming that only half of the deck gets shuffled.

1. Start the shuffle by dropping the top packet (**A**) onto the left hand.
2. As you drop the next packet (**B**) on top of **A**, grab **A** again with the right ring finger and the inside of the right thumb.
3. Keep shuffling as usual until only packet **A** remains in your right hand.
4. Drop packet **A** on top of the rest.

[Associated force](#lift-shuffle-force)

## Riffle shuffle

Cut the deck in two packs, riffle the two packs together so they interlace.

- To retain the top cards during a riffle shuffle, make sure the hand with the top half of the deck finishes last.
- To retain the bottom cards during a riffle shuffle, make sure you start with the hand that has the bottom half of the deck.
- A good subtlety as convincer that the deck is shuffled: cut the deck to the left and retain top by finishing the left, then repeat by cutting the top portion to the right and retaining it (this will appear as if you don't always finish with the same side).

## Hindu shuffle

1. Hold deck with your right hand on top, fingers grasping the the sides of the deck.
2. With your left thumb and fingers, take packets from the top.
3. Drop each packet on top of any packets on the left palm.

# False shuffles

## Charlier shuffle

Has the effect of a simple cut.

1. Hold the packet in the left hand in dealing position.
2. Push a block of cards from the top to your right hand.
3. Push a block of cards from the bottom of the left packet to the top of the right one.
4. Push a block of cards from the top of the left packet to the bottom of the right one.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you run out of cards.

## Cut And Turn Over (CATO)

Discovered by Bob Hummer, it's a method of retaining face up and face down cards seamlessly.

1. Choose the portion of the deck you want to be face up.
2. Give the other pack to the spectator.
3. Both of you shuffle your pack.
4. Both of you cut a portion of your pack, turn it face-up and give it to the other.
5. Both of you take the other's face-up portion and shuffle it into your face-down portion.
6. Remark how this chaotic shuffle not only mixes the order of the cards but also whether they are face up or face down.
6. Repeat as many times as wanted. If at any point the spectator rotates their pack, make sure to rotate yours as well.
7. In your last shuffle, subtly rotate your pack (easy to do after an Overhand Shuffle, just let the cards in the left hand fall back instead of forward).
7. Receive the spectator's portion.

# False cuts

## Simple false cut ?

1. Grab the bottom portion of the deck with the right hand, lifting it as it clears the top portion.
2. (Optional: Square the packet by tapping it's inner bottom edge on top of the other packet).
2. Place the cut packet on the table.
3. Place the other packet on top. When done at speed it gives the illusion of a cut.

## False kick cut

1. Hold the deck in the right hand, thumb in the bottom inner edge and ring finger in the top right corner.
2. Kick cut the top half of the deck from your right hand to your left (use your index finger to throw the top third onto your left hand. Also known as swing cut).
3. Rotate your left hand to hold the top half vertically.
4. Tap the right half on the left half, perpendicularly.
5. Drop the right half on the table.
6. Drop the left half on top.

## False triple cut on table:

1. Cut the top portion to the table
2. Cut a middle portion to the table.
3. Put the bottom of the deck on the table.
4. Pick up the first portion, put on top of the second.
5. Pick everything up, put on top of the last.

## False triple cut on hand

1. Hold the deck in the right hand, thumb in the bottom inner edge and ring finger in the top right corner.
2. Kick cut the top third packet from your right hand to your left (use your index finger to throw the top third onto your left hand. Also known as swing cut).
3. Grab a pinky break above the packet in the left hand.
4. Kick cut the middle third onto the pinky break.
5. Drop the right third on the table.
6. Place the top packet of the right hand on top of the packet on the table.
7. Place the final packet on top.

# Controls

## Backslip control (selection to top)

1. Open the deck bookwise so the spectator can replace their previously chosen card on top of the left pack.
2. Take away the top portion of the deck, but applying pressure with the left fingers to transfer the top card from the right to the left (**backslip**).
3. Insert that card into the middle of the right pack "so it's completely lost".
4. Give that pack to the spectator to shuffle while you false shuffle the left pack.
5. Reassemble the deck with your pack on top. The chosen card is now on top.

## Ed Marlo Convincing Control (selection to bottom)

1. Spread the cards for spectator to touch one.
2. Lift the cards to show them the selected card.
3. While returning spread to dealing position, outjog the card above the selection instead of the selection.
4. Still during the movement, cull the selection with the right fingers to the bottom of the right pack and open it like a book.
5. Close the deck so the selection is now on the bottom of the deck and there is a fake outjogged card.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHQZojNUsVs

## Spread and break control (selection to top)

1. Spread the cards to receive a card to be replaced.
2. When closing the spread after the replacement, catch a break above the replaced card while the spread covers it.
3. Square the deck and pivot it into an overhand lift shuffle, controlling packet **A** as usual.

# False counts

## Biddle count

Way of counting cards to make them appear more than the number they really are.

1. Hold the cards in Biddle grip, in the right hand.
2. Slide the first card to the left hand while counting "one".
3. Before moving the second card to the left hand, prepare a pinky break.
4. While moving the third card to the left hand, steal the second card to the bottom of the pack, using your right fingers.
5. Cound the remaining cards normally.

## Elmsley count

Way of counting cards to make them appear more than the number they really are, or hide face-up cards while counting.

To count 1 more card:

1. Take (e.g.) 4 cards in the right hand, holding them by pinching the inner right corner.
2. Pull the top card with the left thumb, grab the bottom 3 with the right hand, while counting "one".
3. Take the 3 cards and slide them on top of the left one.
4. Grab the previously drawn card with the right fingers to the bottom of the pack.
5. Slide off the top card with the left thumb while counting "two".
6. Count off the remaining 3 cards normally without grabbing the previous one.

To hide the cards between the top 2 and the bottom one:

1. Take (e.g.) 4 cards in the right hand, holding them by pinching the inner right corner.
2. Pull the top card with the left thumb, grab the others with the right hand, while counting "one".
3. Push off all cards except the bottom with the right thumb.
4. Grab the bottom left card with the right fingers to below the kept card (not pushed off).
5. Slide the pushed-off cards to the left hand while counting "two".
6. Count off the remaining cards normally without grabbing the previous ones.

# False deals

## Glide

While holding the deck facedown but with the left hand on top (close to Biddle grip), use the ring finger to slide the facecard backwards so you can bottom deal the second to last (and so on).

## Down under deal

With a packet in hand, alternating dealing a card to the table and moving one to the bottom, it masks that the single remaining card is predetermined.

| Number of cards | Resulting card (from bottom) | Resulting card (from top) |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 8               | 1                            | 8                            |
| 7               | 2                            | 6                            |
| 6               | 3                            | 4                            |
| 5               | 4                            | 2                            |
| 4               | 1                            | 4                            |

This means that if we have 4-8 cards and we want to end up with the bottom card, we can make the necessary modifications before the down-under deal by transfering 8 cards from the top to the bottom (one at a time or in groups).

# Glimpses

Peek at a card that should be hidden (typically the bottom one).

## Bottom glimpse: Deck hand-off

- Give the deck to a spectator to shuffle.
- Often the spectator will shuffle in a way that you can see the bottom card.
- Otherwise, extend the hand to grab it high (at eye level) and tilted so you can peek at the bottom card.

## Bottom glimpse: Point

- Deal a few of the top cards to the right hand.
- Point with the left index finger while turning the bottom card towards you and say something like "these cards are shuffled and in a random order".

## Top card glimpse

- Turn the deck face up.
- Deal some cards to the right hand, showing and saying that they are shuffled.
- Use the left fingers to glimpse at the top card (the lowest in the left hand).

## Previous trick glimpse (any card)

- Do a trick where you finish by spreading the deck (e.g. to show the only face down card) or dealing cards face up
- During that reveal, take the opportunity to glimpse a card in any position of the deck

# Key card

Uses a known/glimpsed card (cut to the top or bottom of the spectator card) to identify a free selection by the spectator.

## Key undercut

1. Glimpse the bottom card.
2. Cut the deck while instructing the spectator to replace the card on top.
3. Last resort, but avoid: glimpse now the bottom card of the pack in the right hand by pointing to the left pack while saying the instruction to replace the card.
4. Complete the cut, putting the key card on top of the chosen card.

## Sliding key card

1. Glimpse the bottom card.
2. Fan out cards for free choice and free replacement.
3. While spectator looks at card, slide the key card below onto the right hand.
4. After replacement, grab right pack and key card with right hand and place on top of chosen card.


# Forces

### Cross-cut force (Crisscross cut force)

1. Instruct the spectator to cut the deck anywhere.
2. Finish the cut in a cross so it's noticeable where the deck was cut.
3. Spend some time explaining the trick you will do afterwards.
4. Instruct the spectator to turn over the top card of the bottom portion, reinforcing that it's the card they cut to (in fact, it isn't, it is the card that was initially on top of the deck).

### Hindu force (bottom card)

1. Start a Hindu shuffle.
2. When spectator calls stop, show them the bottom card of the right hand.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5OHLu8Nys)

### Backslip force

1. Hold the deck in the left hand, face to the palm.
2. Use right hand to riffle, spectator says stop.
3. Take away the top portion of the deck, but applying pressure with the left fingers to transfer the top card from the right to the left.
4. Spectator takes top card of the left pack (your forced card).

Dave Williamson addition: 

1. Instead of immediately transfering the card, spread the top of the right pack.
2. Point with the right thumb, gaining a reason to pivot the left hand, explaining that they could have stopped somewhere else.
3. While moving the thumb over the cards they could have picked, transfer the card to the left using the left fingers.

Video: https://youtu.be/Ar_c5kdHKew?t=680

### Swing cut force

1. Riffle through the deck until spectator calls stop.
2. Start a swing cut on the stopped portion.
3. After tapping both portions of the deck, use your right forefinger to outjog the top card of the left portion (previous top card).
4. Place the right packet on top.

### Lift shuffle force

1. Start the Overhand lift shuffle and ask a spectator to tell you when to stop.
2. When they yell stop, drop packet **A** on top of the deck.
3. The previous top card is on top.

# Color changes

Apparently transforming one card in another.

## Shake color change

1. Pick two cards back-to-back with thumb and middle finger on opposite corners.
2. While shaking, use the ring finger and/or index finger to rotate the cards together.
3. Place the two cards on top of deck.
4. Pick up only the top one to hand out for examination.

# Double lifts

Lifting the top two cards while appearing to just be showing the top card.

Usually has two phases:

1. The *get-ready*: usually catching a pinky break on the top two cards.
2. The *turnover*: the actual turn of the top two cards.


# Vanishes

## Palm vanish

1. Cup your hand over a card.
2. Hold it with the palm, keeping the fingers close together so the card is not visible.
3. Lift the hand, taking the hidden card with it.

## Backpalm vanish

1. Hold the card with the pinky and the index finger, like a spiderman move.
2. Use the middle and ring finger to rotate the card, holding it with the other two fingers.
3. Hide it by holding just a tiny bit with the fingers.

Mask the sleight by moving your hand while you do it.

# Flourishes

## Springing the cards

1. Square the deck.
2. Hold the deck in the right hand, with the thumb on the bottom left corner and the middle finger on the top right corner.
3. The fingers should be barely touching the last card.
4. Place the first finger touching the middle finger.
5. Squeeze the deck while relaxing the thumb and let cards shoot out.
6. The left hand should use the pinky and thumb to trap the cards inside roughly squared.
7. Hand distance should increase and then decrease again.

# Other principles

## Multiple outs / I make the rules

Because the magician does not reveal what will happen next, they can change their actions along the way. For instance, if a selected card is 4th from the top, a selected number of 3 or 4 can find it:
- If the chosen number is 3, the magician can say "the next card is your card!".
- If the chosen number is 4, the magician can say "the last card dealt is your card!".

# Stacks

## Si Stebbins

- Very little memorization.
- Colors alternate.

Order:
- Values increment by 3: A-4-7-10-K-3-6-9-Q-2-5-8-J (top to face).
- Suits alternate clubs-hearts-spades-diamonds (**CH**a**S**e**D**).

# Practice routines

## First practice routine

1. Overhand shuffle
2. Double lift
3. Elmsley count


# Tricks

## Water and Oil

1. Choose 3 red cards and 3 black cards.
2. Spread them on your hands facing the audience. The black cards should be on the right.
3. While turning them facedown, use your left thumb and right middle finger to switch the middle two cards and separate them into two piles, grabbed by each hand.
4. You will now put cards (alternating from each pile) to the middle, starting with the right pile.
5. You explain that you're putting a black card, then a red, a black, then a red, etc.
6. You can show cards 1, 3, 4, 6 while moving them.
7. You explain that black ink is thicker and thus heavier. By waving the cards, the black cards will fall to the bottom.
8. You show that the top three cards are red and the bottom three are black.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsPap-P06jI


## Power of fours

1. Fan the deck face up while saying they're all in a random order.
2. Peek at the fourth card.
3. Riffle shuffle maintaining top stock.
4. Ask the spectator to cut anywhere.
5. Say that by looking at the fourth card of one of the packs, you'll know what the fourth card in the other pack will be.
6. Name the first peeked card and flip the fourth card of the top pack.
7. Put the bottom pack on top. The trick is now reset and you know which card is in fourth position.

## Back to the Future

Based on Back to The Future (Roberto Giobbi - Card College Light, based on *The spectator does a trick* by Al Leech) and [Decisions by MLT Magic Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXrmygSTowo).

1. Ask the spectator to shuffle.
2. Say that sometimes predictions are not supernatural powers. Sometimes they are just visions from the future. One needs only to transport themselves into the future, see the result of our present actions and come back with that knowledge. Close your eyes for a moment. Open them a few seconds later and say that you have seen exactly the outcome of the next few minutes.
3. Say that you will thus make a prediction using a card in the deck.
4. Look at the cards. Check the value of the first card and suit of the second (or vice versa) and take out a "prediction card" facedown on the table that is the combination of the two. If impossible, change the first cards to make it possible (e.g. by hesitating on a prediction or asking for more shuffling).
5. (Optional) Shuffle retaining top two.
6. Ask spectator to deal some cards from the top and stop when they want (between 10 and 20 or so).
7. (Optional) After they have dealt at least 2 cards, say "of course you can deal from the middle or from the bottom as well if you want. Or even shuffle again.".
8. Ask them to deal from that pile into two different piles (alternating). The "selected" cards are now on top of each pile.
9. Ask them to take one pile and deal some cards from it.
10. Reverse it by counting it and saying that we will need the same number of cards from the second pile.
11. Deal the same number of cards from the other pile on top of the previous.
12. Eliminate pairs of cards from the edges of the pile. You can spread them and take from one edge while the spectator takes from the other.
13. Remind the spectator that they shuffled, they dealt, they chose how many cards to deal each time. And yet...
14. The two center cards determine the number and suit of the prediction.


## Manto

By Richard Vollmer, read in Roberto Giobbi - Card College Light.

1. (Setup or peek the first 21 cards of the deck, counting how many red/black.)
2. Write a prediction that says: "There are 21 cards face up. X Are red. Y are black."
3. Use the [Cut And Turn Over](#cut-and-turn-over-cato) principle to apparently shuffle the order and orientation of the cards.
4. Summarize that the deck was shuffled not only by you but also your spectator, with complete freedom to cut and turn over cards. Nevertheless...
5. Reveal the correct prediction and spread the deck, counting the cards and how many are red/black.

## Posi-negative coordination (Card College Lightest)

1. Setup: alternate colors in deck. Alternatively, alternate colors in only one portion and use that portion.
2. Spread the deck irregularly (so some colors seem to repeat) and show that it is "shuffled", saying "values are all mixed" to pull attention towards the values and not the colors.
3. Separate into two halves, the bottom colors must be different.
4. Riffle shuffle the two halves together. Spectator can square them.
5. (Due to the Gilbreath principle, colors either alternate or repeat only once. No group of 3 ever occurs.)
6. Tell the spectator to deal a card face down to the left and another face up to the right.
7. Repeat the previous step until all cards are dealt.
8. During the deal, point out how the face-up pile is naturally random.
9. Say that this step is to build up coordination inside the spectator, between their left side and right side.
10. Have the spectator take the face-up pile and deal red cards to the left and black cards to the right.
11. Say this step is to synchronize your coordination to theirs, and we'll see if they match.
12. Do the same with your face-down cards, when the spectator puts a card to their left you put a card to **_your_** left.
13. Reveal the face-down piles and show that your black cards are underneath the spectator's black cards, and the same for red.
14. The coordination/synchronization was a success!

## Man seeks woman

This trick uses the Ramasee principle, where you reverse one of the piles and loop any of the piles until they match.

1. Grab the 4 Kings and 4 Queens in the same order of suits.
2. "When cards were first introduced, they mirrored society, just like the game of chess. With time, that has been lost, but I'd like to revive it for today. The Kings and Queens will stand for men and women of our times, in search of their match".
3. Place one packet on top of the other.
4. Cut and/or Charlier shuffle. Optionally, Charlier shuffle face up.
5. Deal the top four cards to your left (reversing their order).
6. Show the remaining 4 cards and place them face down on the right.
7. Have the spectator slide a card from the top of either packet to its bottom, 3 times (like typing "man"), or 4x + 3 times (3, 7, 11, ...).
8. (Multiple cards can be moved at once).
9. Point out that if the spectator chose differently, different cards would be on top.
10. Remove the top card of each packet together to the side.
11. Repeat step 6, now 5 times (like typing "seeks"), or 3x + 2 times (2, 5, 8, ...).
12. Remove the top card of each packet together to the side.
13. Repeat step 6, now 5 times (like typing "woman"), or any odd number of times (1, 3, 5, 7, ...).
14. Reveal that the pairs are all matched up!

**Alternate presentation**: since you can use infinite numbers for each slide, you can ask the spectator to guess how many "tinder swipes" each card did before matching. If they hit a good number (e.g. an odd number in the last step), the trick will seem even more impossible. Otherwise, just say you feel like they needed a bit more and add as many cards as you need.


## Biddle trick

1. Force a card or use a key card.
2. Spread the deck and choose 5 cards where the second is the chosen card.
3. Place the cards on top of the deck and hold only the top half of the deck (including those cards) in Biddle grip.
4. Show each card one by one, moving them to the left hand.
5. The spectator should reply mentally to each one whether that's their card.
6. Before moving the second card to the left hand, prepare a pinky break.
7. When moving the third card to the left hand, steal the second card to the bottom of the pack, using your right fingers.
8. Place the top half back on the deck.
9. Biddle count or Elmsley count the 4 cards as 5 (facedown).
10. Tell them to hold on to the 5 cards.
11. Their card is still inside the deck, faceup.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTPG1HsvQ2E

Alternative:

Don't use a key card, control the card to second from the bottom (e.g. control to the top and then keep top and bottom cards while overhand shuffling).
You can then make the 5 card selection facedown, which adds to the effect.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8pePRJs4wo

## Truth Detector (inspired by Lie Detector of Card College Light)

1. Force a card, e.g.: Glimpse the top card by spreading the deck with the "deck is shuffled line" and use a cross-cut to force the top card.
2. Explain that the voice betrays the sincerity of a person, and by hearing alone you can detect whether someone is lying. Thus you want to conduct an experiment to detect when they are truthful.
3. The spectator is to select another 4 cards and hold them alongside their card.
4. You turn your back to the spectator.
5. The spectator names every card they're holding saying "My card is the &lt;name of the card&gt;".
6. After some theatrics you identify their card saying that their voice was more solid when they said that name.

## Mr. King's Tapestry

Story: "Mr. King, a great lover of art, bought a rare tapestry. It had beautiful patterns, looked a little something like this":

Take out the 4 Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens and make a grid with them, face up (R = Random, K = King):

```
R R K K
R R R R
K R R K
R R R R
```

"Mr. King knew the value of the tapestry, so he asked his initial to be woven into it."

Flip some cards face down in a shape of a K, facing your spectators.


```
D U U D
U D U D
U U D D
U D U D
```

"Unfortunately, Mr. King was right to mark it, as it got stolen a few days later. A few suspicious figures broke into Mr. King's home and rolled the tapestry up."

Instruct the spectator to "roll" (flip) any edge on top of the inner row/column, until only a pile remains. This will put the CATO principle into action.

"The thieves sold the tapestry to an antique dealer. One day Mr. King passed by the shop and instantly recognized it. The shop owner asked for proof, of course, and Mr. King was happy to oblige: he rolled the tapestry and four hidden motifs emerged."

Spread the deck, reveal that only 4 cards are face down: they are the Kings!

This trick works with any combination of cards and patterns. To create one yourself, copy the following alternating (CATO) pattern:

```
D U D U
U D U D
D U D U
U D U D
```

Given this original pattern, consider that every position with a card that you want to reveal in the end needs to be flipped. Notice how in the original trick the Kings are placed and flip the 3rd, 4th, 9th and 12th positions.


## Fully Automatic Aces (Card College Lighter)

1. Setup: Ace of Spades, Red Ace, &lt;deck&gt;, Red Ace, Ace of Clubs.
2. Say you will show many different ways to manipulate the deck.
3. False cut / False shuffle.
4. Reveal the top Ace by turning it over.
5. Say that this was evidently sleight of hand, but in this day and age we don't have time for manipulations.
6. Press the top and bottom cards and throw the rest of the deck onto the left hand.
7. The bottom Ace should remain face down in the right hand. Reveal it.
8. Drop the Aces onto the table and hold the deck in dealing position.
9. Deal cards until a spectator calls stop. Reinforce that they could have stopped anywhere.
10. Drop one black Ace on top of the pile you dealt and drop the rest of the deck on it.
11. Repeat the process.
12. Ribbon spread the deck, say you used the spectator and the Aces to find the other Aces!
13. Use the black Aces to turn over the cards on top of them: it's the red Aces!

If the audience is on the other side of the table, ribbon spread the deck from the right to the left, in order to position the face-up cards left of the cards to be revealed (in the audience's perspective). This will reinforce that the reveals are "after" (to the right) the key cards.

# Gimmicks

## Invisible Deck

The Invisible Deck is a gimmicked deck where the card backs are treated with roughing fluid so they stick together. Half of the deck is therefore facing up (e.g. odd cards plus red Kings) and the other is facing down (e.g. even cards with black Kings).

The usual routine with the invisible deck is:

1. Ask the spectator to imagine he takes an invisible deck.
2. They take the deck out of the box, spread the cards and choose any one.
3. They turn that card face down.
4. They put the deck inside the imagined box and give it/throw it to you.
5. You open the Invisible Deck, spread it and find the pair of the selected card, separate it and show a face-down card.
6. The face-down card is the selected card.

Pairing of the cards:
- All odd cards are facing the same way.
- All even cards are facing the same way.
- Spades are paired with Hearts.
- Clubs are paired with Diamonds.
- Each pair sums 13 (Ace = 1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12).
- Kings are paired together.
- Red Kings are on the odd side.
- Black Kings are on the even side.

Mnemonic for the position of the deck in the box:
- Odd side facing the Ace on the box
- Even side facing the 2 rider drawings (or the 10 of hearts).

Handling tips:
- Press hard when spreading the deck.
- Grab the selected card with the left fingers while spreading its pair with the right thumb.
- To instantly reset, don’t square the deck while showing selection, hold it on one hand while the other shows the selection and returns it in its original position.
- Simplified Craig Petty handling:
  1. Open the deck pair-side up.
  2. Lift selected side towards you.
  3. Just search for the selected card, separate it and outjog it to show its back.
- To break the deck in:
  1. Dribble the cards a few times.
  2. Rub each pair against each other.

### Routines with the Invisible Deck

Idea: Join elements from Craig Petty's Across with the presentation of ["Back to the Future" by Pit Hartling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfLpHBe3QV4).

1. Announce you will invert time and do a trick in reverse.
2. You choose a card from the deck and announce "this is your card!", but you reveal it to have no face.
3. "The card has no face yet because you haven't selected it from the deck yet!"
4. Switch it with a forced regular card and place it face down to the side.
5. Force a duplicate with the Invisible Deck.
6. The spectator peeks at the card, puts it face down in the deck.
7. You spread the deck showing the card is gone.
8. The "prediction"/"found" card now has a face. It is the selected card!


# Presentation ideas

- Keep the routines short (3 tricks, 15 minutes altogether)
- "May I ask you to help me? You'll get 50% of course. 50% of the applause!" (Roberto Giobbi)
- For tricks with a small number of cards, consider replacing the cards with pieces of cardboard with other texts (names, emotions, etc). (Roberto Giobbi)
