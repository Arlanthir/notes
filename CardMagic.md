# Card Magic

## Rules

1. The _patter_, story and personality of each performance is what makes it enjoyable and memorable.
2. Never announce your intention until all preliminary actions which make it possible are completed.
3. Never repeat a trick without replicating it by a different method.


## Important terms

- **Overhand shuffle**: Shuffling by grabbing bottom portion of deck with right hand, progressively putting cards from the top of the right pile to the left.
- **Run**: While performing an overhand shuffle, take cards one by one from the right pile to the top of the left pile using the left thumb.
- **Injog**: While running cards, move the right hand closer to the body so the drawn card is shifted towards you.
- **Outjog**: Same as injog, but the card protrudes away from you.
- **Riffle shuffle**: The usual gamers' shuffle that riffles two halves of the deck together.
- **Pinky break**: Hold the left pinky between top and bottom packets to keep the position and later do a sleight (like a cut, etc).. You should then square the deck and switch the pinky break from being between packets to just pressed against the gap.


## Sleights

### Overhand shuffle

#### Control the top card

1. Use left thumb to grab onto top card while right hand takes the rest of deck.
2. Overhand shuffle as normal. Card is now on the bottom.
3. Overhand shuffle while running the last few cards until only the one remains.

#### Control the bottom card

1. Apply pressure with the left fingers to keep bottom card while grabbing the portion to really shuffle.
2. Overhand shuffle as usual. Bottom card remains.

#### Retain top and bottom

1. Apply pressure with left thumb and fingers so the top and bottom cards remain and the rest of the deck is overhand shuffled.
2. The previous top card is now second from the bottom. The bottom card is retained.
3. Overhand shuffle while running the last few cards until only the one remains. Top and bottom cards are now in the original position.

#### Undercut

1. While overhanding shuffling, injog the first card.
2. Shuffle the other cards as normal, injogging some cards to distract from the first injog.
3. After the shuffle, grab the deck from below the injogged card and cut it onto the top of the left pack.
4. The top cards are retained.

Optionally run some cards before injogging to put that number of cards on top of the previous top card. E.g. run 1 card before injogging to place a single card on top, preparing a later double lift.

#### Overhand false shuffle

1. Begin the overhand shuffle.
2. Run 5 cards.
3. Drop the rest of the pack on top, outjogged.
4. Grab the bottom pack, run 5 cards.
5. Drop the rest of the pack on top.

The deck remains in the original position.

### Riffle shuffle

- To retain the top cards during a riffle shuffle, make sure the hand with the top half of the deck finishes last.
- To retain the bottom cards during a riffle shuffle, make sure you start with the hand that has the bottom half of the deck.

### Elmsley count

Way of counting cards to make them appear more than the number they really are.

1. Take (e.g.) 4 cards in the left hand.
2. Push the top card with the thumb, grab the bottom 3 with the right hand, while counting "one".
3. Take the 3 cards and slide them on top of the left one.
4. Grab the previously drawn card with the right fingers to the bottom of the pack.
5. Slide off the top card with the left thumb while counting "two".
6. Count off the remaining 3 cards normally without grabbing the previous one.

### Glide

While holding the deck facedown but with the left hand on top, use the ring finger to slide the facecard backwards so you can bottom deal the second to last (and so on).

### Glimpse

Peek at a card that should be hidden (typically the bottom one).

#### Bottom glimpse: Deck hand-off

- Give the deck to a spectator to shuffle.
- Often the spectator will shuffle in a way that you can see the bottom card.
- Otherwise, extend the hand to grab it high (at eye level) and tilted so you can peek at the bottom card.

#### Bottom glimpse: Point

- Deal a few of the top cards to the right hand.
- Point with the left index finger while turning the bottom card towards you and say something like "these cards are shuffled and in a random order".

#### Top card glimpse

- Turn the deck face up.
- Deal some cards to the right hand, showing that they are shuffled.
- Use the left fingers to glimpse at the top card (the lowest in the left hand).

### Double lift

Lifting the top two cards while appearing to just be showing the top card.

Usually has two phases:

1. The *get-ready*: usually catching a pinky break on the top two cards.
2. The *turnover*: the actual turn of the top two cards.

### Palm vanish

1. Cup your hand over a card.
2. Hold it with the palm, keeping the fingers close together so the card is not visible.
3. Lift the hand, taking the hidden card with it.

### Backpalm vanish

1. Hold the card with the pinky and the index finger, like a spiderman move.
2. Use the middle and ring finger to rotate the card, holding it with the other two fingers.
3. Hide it by holding just a tiny bit with the fingers.

Mask the sleight by moving your hand while you do it.

### Key card

#### Key undercut

1. Glimpse the bottom card.
2. Cut the deck while instructing the spectator to replace the card on top.
3. Last resort, but avoid: glimpse now the bottom card of the pack in the right hand by pointing to the left pack while saying the instruction to replace the card.
4. Complete the cut, putting the key card on top of the chosen card.

#### Sliding key card

1. Glimpse the bottom card.
2. Fan out cards for free choice and free replacement.
3. While spectator looks at card, slide the key card below onto the right hand.
4. After replacement, grab right pack and key card with right hand and place on top of chosen card.

### Backslip force

1. Hold the deck in the left hand, face to the palm.
2. Use right hand to riffle, spectator says stop.
3. Take away the top portion of the deck, but applying pressure with the left fingers to transfer the top card from the right to the left.
4. Spectator takes top card of the left pack (your forced card).

Dave Williamson addition: 

1. Instead of immediately transfering the card, spread the top of the right pack.
2. Point with the right thumb, gaining a reason to pivot the left hand, explaining that they could have stopped somewhere else.
3. While moving the thumb over the cards they could have picked, transfer the card to the left using the left fingers.

4. Give that pack to the spectator to shuffle while you false shuffle the left pack.
5. Reassemble the deck with your pack on top. The chosen card is now on top.

### Overhand lift shuffle

Maintains top stock without seeming that only half of the deck gets shuffled.

1. Start the shuffle by dropping the top packet (**A**) onto the left hand.
2. As you drop the next packet (**B**) on top of **A**, grab **A** again with the right ring finger and the inside of the right thumb.
3. Keep shuffling as usual until only packet **A** remains in your right hand.
4. Drop packet **A** on top of the rest.

### Lift shuffle force

# Tricks

## Water and Oil

1. Choose 3 red cards and 3 black cards.
2. Spread them on your hands facing the audience. The black cards should be on the right.
3. While turning them facedown, use your left thumb and right middle finger to switch the middle two cards and separate them into two piles, grabbed by each hand.
4. You will now put cards (alternating from each pile) to the middle, starting with the right pile.
5. You explain that you're putting a black card, then a red, a black, then a red, etc.
6. You can show cards 1, 3, 4, 6 while moving them.
7. You explain that black ink is thicker and thus heavier. By waving the cards, the black cards will fall to the bottom.
8. You show that the top three cards are red and the bottom three are black.

## Decisions

1. Ask the spectator to shuffle.
2. Look at the cards. Check the value of the first card and suit of the second and take out a "prediction card" facedown on the table that is the combination of the two. If impossible, change the first cards to make it possible (e.g. by hesitating on a prediction or asking for more shuffling).
3. Shuffle retaining top two.
4. Ask spectator to deal some cards from the top and stop when they want (between 10 and 20 or so).
5. Ask them to deal from that pile into two different piles (alternating).
6. Ask them to take one pile and deal some cards from it.
7. Reverse it by counting it.
8. Deal the same number of cards from the other pile on top of the previous.
9. Eliminate pairs of cards from the edges of the pile. You can spread them and take from one edge while the spectator takes from the other.
10. The two center cards determine the number and suit of the prediction.

2. Spread the deck and choose 5 cards where the second is the chosen card.
3. Place the cards on top of the deck and hold only the top portion.
4. Show each card one by one, moving them to the left hand.

7. Place the top portion back on the deck.
8. Elmsley count the 4 cards as 5 (facedown).
9. Tell them to hold on to the 5 cards.

Alternative:

Don't use a key card, control the card to second from the bottom (e.g. control to the top and then keep top and bottom cards while overhand shuffling).
You can then make the 5 card selection facedown, which adds to the effect.
