# Card Magic

# Rules

1. The _patter_, story and personality of each performance is what makes it enjoyable and memorable.
2. Never announce your intention until all preliminary actions which make it possible are completed.
3. Never repeat a trick without replicating it by a different method.
4. Think of the sleights as *your safety net in case the misdirection goes wrong*.
5. Don't run when you're not being chased: don't overjustify regular things that the audience has no reason to suspect (yet).


# Important terms

- **Run**: While performing an overhand shuffle, take cards one by one from the right pile to the top of the left pile using the left thumb.
- **Injog**: While running cards, move the right hand closer to the body so the drawn card is shifted towards you.
- **Outjog**: Same as injog, but the card protrudes away from you.
- **Pinky break**: Hold the left pinky between top and bottom packets to keep the position and later do a sleight (like a cut, etc).. You should then square the deck and switch the pinky break from being between packets to just pressed against the gap.
- **Biddle grip**: Hold the deck with the hand above it, thumb to one side and fingers to the other.
- **Onbeat**: During the performance of a trick, while the audience is invested and with full attention.
- **Offbeat**: While the audience thinks the trick is finished, and the attention dwindles.


# Shuffles

## Overhand shuffle

Shuffling by grabbing bottom portion of deck with right hand, progressively putting cards from the top of the right pile to the left.

### Control the top card

1. Use left thumb to grab onto top card while right hand takes the rest of deck.
2. Overhand shuffle as normal. Card is now on the bottom.
3. Overhand shuffle while running the last few cards until only the one remains.

### Control the bottom card

1. Apply pressure with the left fingers to keep bottom card while grabbing the portion to really shuffle.
2. Overhand shuffle as usual. Bottom card remains.

### Retain top and bottom

1. Apply pressure with left thumb and fingers so the top and bottom cards remain and the rest of the deck is overhand shuffled.
2. The previous top card is now second from the bottom. The bottom card is retained.
3. Overhand shuffle while running the last few cards until only the one remains. Top and bottom cards are now in the original position.

### Undercut (retain top stock)

1. While overhanding shuffling, injog the first card.
2. Shuffle the other cards as normal, injogging some cards to distract from the first injog.
3. After the shuffle, grab the deck from below the injogged card and cut it onto the top of the left pack.
4. The top cards are retained.

Optionally run some cards before injogging to put that number of cards on top of the previous top card. E.g. run 1 card before injogging to place a single card on top, preparing a later double lift.

### Overhand false shuffle

1. Begin the overhand shuffle.
2. Run 5 cards.
3. Drop the rest of the pack on top, outjogged.
4. Grab the bottom pack, run 5 cards.
5. Drop the rest of the pack on top.

The deck remains in the original position.

### Overhand lift shuffle

Maintains top stock without seeming that only half of the deck gets shuffled.

1. Start the shuffle by dropping the top packet (**A**) onto the left hand.
2. As you drop the next packet (**B**) on top of **A**, grab **A** again with the right ring finger and the inside of the right thumb.
3. Keep shuffling as usual until only packet **A** remains in your right hand.
4. Drop packet **A** on top of the rest.

## Riffle shuffle

Cut the deck in two packs, riffle the two packs together so they interlace.

- To retain the top cards during a riffle shuffle, make sure the hand with the top half of the deck finishes last.
- To retain the bottom cards during a riffle shuffle, make sure you start with the hand that has the bottom half of the deck.
- A good subtlety as convincer that the deck is shuffled: cut the deck to the left and retain top by finishing the left, then repeat by cutting the top portion to the right and retaining it (this will appear as if you don't always finish with the same side).
- Another good subtlety is to stare at the deck while squaring and preparing to cut, but stare at the spectators and say something while splitting the piles. They will instinctively meet your eyes and miss the separation of the piles.

## Hindu shuffle

1. Hold deck with your right hand on top, fingers grasping the the sides of the deck.
2. With your left thumb and fingers, take packets from the top.
3. Drop each packet on top of any packets on the left palm.

# False shuffles

## Charlier shuffle

Has the effect of a simple cut.

1. Hold the packet in the left hand in dealing position.
2. Push a block of cards from the top to your right hand.
3. Push a block of cards from the bottom of the left packet to the top of the right one.
4. Push a block of cards from the top of the left packet to the bottom of the right one.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you run out of cards.

## Cut And Turn Over (CATO)

Discovered by Bob Hummer, it's a method of retaining face up and face down cards seamlessly.

1. Choose the portion of the deck you want to be face up.
2. Give the other pack to the spectator.
3. Both of you shuffle your pack.
4. Both of you cut a portion of your pack, turn it face-up and give it to the other.
5. Both of you take the other's face-up portion and shuffle it into your face-down portion.
6. Remark how this chaotic shuffle not only mixes the order of the cards but also whether they are face up or face down.
6. Repeat as many times as wanted. If at any point the spectator rotates their pack, make sure to rotate yours as well.
7. In your last shuffle, subtly rotate your pack (easy to do after an Overhand Shuffle, just let the cards in the left hand fall back instead of forward).
7. Receive the spectator's portion.

# False cuts

## Simple false cut ?

1. Grab the bottom portion of the deck with the right hand, lifting it as it clears the top portion.
2. (Optional: Square the packet by tapping it's inner bottom edge on top of the other packet).
2. Place the cut packet on the table.
3. Place the other packet on top. When done at speed it gives the illusion of a cut.

## False kick cut

1. Hold the deck in the right hand, thumb in the bottom inner edge and ring finger in the top right corner.
2. Kick cut the top half of the deck from your right hand to your left (use your index finger to throw the top third onto your left hand. Also known as swing cut).
3. Rotate your left hand to hold the top half vertically.
4. Tap the right half on the left half, perpendicularly.
5. Drop the right half on the table.
6. Drop the left half on top.

## False triple cut on table:

1. Cut the top portion to the table
2. Cut a middle portion to the table.
3. Put the bottom of the deck on the table.
4. Pick up the first portion, put on top of the second.
5. Pick everything up, put on top of the last.

## False triple cut on hand

1. Hold the deck in the right hand, thumb in the bottom inner edge and ring finger in the top right corner.
2. Kick cut the top third packet from your right hand to your left (use your index finger to throw the top third onto your left hand. Also known as swing cut).
3. Grab a pinky break above the packet in the left hand.
4. Kick cut the middle third onto the pinky break.
5. Drop the right third on the table.
6. Place the top packet of the right hand on top of the packet on the table.
7. Place the final packet on top.

# Controls

## Backslip control (selection to top)

1. Open the deck bookwise so the spectator can replace their previously chosen card on top of the left pack.
2. Take away the top portion of the deck, but applying pressure with the left fingers to transfer the top card from the right to the left (**backslip**).
3. Insert that card into the middle of the right pack "so it's completely lost".
4. Give that pack to the spectator to shuffle while you false shuffle the left pack (alternatively just cut that portion to the bottom).
5. Reassemble the deck with your pack on top. The chosen card is now on top.

## Ed Marlo Convincing Control (selection to bottom)

1. Spread the cards for spectator to touch one.
2. Grab the cards with the right hand, the spectator's card is the bottom one.
3. Lift the cards to show them the selected card, while positioning it close to the second from the bottom.
4. Lift your left hand to help show the card.
5. While returning spread to dealing position, cull the bottom card with the right hand so that the second from the bottom is the one on the edge.
6. Still during movement, press the culled card to open it like a book and make space for the rest of the deck.
7. Outjog the fake selection by returning the right hand cards to regular position without it.
8. Close the deck so the selection is now on the bottom of the deck and there is a fake outjogged card.

Video: https://youtu.be/5qD6iLTA6ys?si=Nap1Th7xqFudrEpc&t=408

## Spread and break control (selection to top)

1. Spread the cards to receive a card to be replaced.
2. When closing the spread after the replacement, catch a break above the replaced card while the spread covers it.
3. Square the deck and pivot it into an overhand lift shuffle, controlling packet **A** as usual.

## Double undercut (stock to bottom)

1. Hold a pinky break under the stock.
2. Transfer to a right thumb break while separating roughly half the deck.
3. Use the left hand to cut the bottom half to on top of the break.
4. Use the break to cut that portion to the bottom.

# False counts

## Biddle count

Way of counting cards to make them appear more than the number they really are.

1. Hold the cards in Biddle grip, in the right hand.
2. Slide the first card to the left hand while counting "one".
3. Before moving the second card to the left hand, prepare a pinky break.
4. While moving the third card to the left hand, steal the second card to the bottom of the pack, using your right fingers.
5. Cound the remaining cards normally.

## Elmsley count

Way of counting cards to make them appear more than the number they really are, or hide face-up cards while counting.

To count 1 more card:

1. Take (e.g.) 4 cards in the right hand, holding them by pinching the inner right corner.
2. Pull the top card with the left thumb, grab the bottom 3 with the right hand, while counting "one".
3. Take the 3 cards and slide them on top of the left one.
4. Grab the previously drawn card with the right fingers to the bottom of the pack.
5. Slide off the top card with the left thumb while counting "two".
6. Count off the remaining 3 cards normally without grabbing the previous one.

To hide the cards between the top 2 and the bottom one:

1. Take (e.g.) 4 cards in the right hand, holding them by pinching the inner right corner.
2. Pull the top card with the left thumb, grab the others with the right hand, while counting "one".
3. Push off all cards except the bottom with the right thumb.
4. Grab the bottom left card with the right fingers to below the kept card (not pushed off).
5. Slide the pushed-off cards to the left hand while counting "two".
6. Count off the remaining cards normally without grabbing the previous ones.

# False deals

## Glide

While holding the deck facedown but with the left hand on top (close to Biddle grip), use the ring finger to slide the facecard backwards so you can bottom deal the second to last (and so on).

## Down under deal

With a packet in hand, alternating dealing a card to the table and moving one to the bottom, it masks that the single remaining card is predetermined.

| Number of cards | Resulting card (from bottom) | Resulting card (from top) |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 8               | 1                            | 8                            |
| 7               | 2                            | 6                            |
| 6               | 3                            | 4                            |
| 5               | 4                            | 2                            |
| 4               | 1                            | 4                            |

This means that if we have 4-8 cards and we want to end up with the bottom card, we can make the necessary modifications before the down-under deal by transfering 8 cards from the top to the bottom (one at a time or in groups).

# Glimpses

Peek at a card that should be hidden (typically the bottom one).

## Bottom glimpse: Deck hand-off

- Give the deck to a spectator to shuffle.
- Often the spectator will shuffle in a way that you can see the bottom card.
- Otherwise, extend the hand to grab it high (at eye level) and tilted so you can peek at the bottom card.

## Bottom glimpse: Point

- Deal a few of the top cards to the right hand.
- Point with the left index finger while turning the bottom card towards you and say something like "these cards are shuffled and in a random order".

## Top card glimpse

- Turn the deck face up.
- Deal some cards to the right hand, showing and saying that they are shuffled.
- Use the left fingers to glimpse at the top card (the lowest in the left hand).

## Previous trick glimpse (any card)

- Do a trick where you finish by spreading the deck (e.g. to show the only face down card) or dealing cards face up
- During that reveal, take the opportunity to glimpse a card in any position of the deck

# Key card

Uses a known/glimpsed card (cut to the top or bottom of the spectator card) to identify a free selection by the spectator.

## Key undercut

1. Glimpse the bottom card.
2. Cut the deck while instructing the spectator to replace the card on top.
3. Last resort, but avoid: glimpse now the bottom card of the pack in the right hand by pointing to the left pack while saying the instruction to replace the card.
4. Complete the cut, putting the key card on top of the chosen card.

## Sliding key card

1. Glimpse the bottom card.
2. Fan out cards for free choice and free replacement.
3. While spectator looks at card, slide the key card below onto the right hand.
4. After replacement, grab right pack and key card with right hand and place on top of chosen card.


# Forces

### Cross-cut force (Crisscross cut force)

1. Instruct the spectator to cut the deck anywhere.
2. Finish the cut in a cross so it's noticeable where the deck was cut.
3. Spend some time explaining the trick you will do afterwards.
4. Instruct the spectator to turn over the top card of the bottom portion, reinforcing that it's the card they cut to (in fact, it isn't, it is the card that was initially on top of the deck).

### Hindu force (bottom card)

1. Start a Hindu shuffle.
2. When spectator calls stop, show them the bottom card of the right hand.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5OHLu8Nys)

### Backslip force

1. Hold the deck in the left hand, face to the palm.
2. Use right hand to riffle, spectator says stop.
3. Take away the top portion of the deck, but applying pressure with the left fingers to transfer the top card from the right to the left.
4. Spectator takes top card of the left pack (your forced card).

Dave Williamson addition: 

1. Instead of immediately transfering the card, spread the top of the right pack.
2. Point with the right thumb, gaining a reason to pivot the left hand, explaining that they could have stopped somewhere else.
3. While moving the thumb over the cards they could have picked, transfer the card to the left using the left fingers.

Video: https://youtu.be/Ar_c5kdHKew?t=680

### Swing cut force

1. Riffle through the deck until spectator calls stop.
2. Start a swing cut on the stopped portion.
3. After tapping both portions of the deck, use your right forefinger to outjog the top card of the left portion (previous top card).
4. Place the right packet on top.

### Lift shuffle force

1. Start the Overhand lift shuffle and ask a spectator to tell you when to stop.
2. When they yell stop, drop packet **A** on top of the deck.
3. The previous top card is on top.

### 10-20 force

Forces 9th card from the top. Transforms a number choice into a card force.

1. Ask the spectator to name a number **_between_** 10 and 20 (therefore excluding 10 and 20).
2. Deal that many cards off the deck (reversing them).
3. Add the two digits of the spectator's number.
4. Deal that many cards from the previously dealt pile.
   - Alternatively: If someone names, e.g., "17," mention that the number consists of a "1" (deal 1 card) and a "7" (deal 7 cards).
5. The final dealt card is the one that was originally in the 9th position from the top of the deck.

### Timing force

1. Have the card on top.
2. Swivel cut about a fourth of the deck to your left hand and hold a pinky break.
3. Put the other cards on top.
4. Start cutting packets to the table while you ask for the spectator to say stop.
5. Time it so you cut 3 packets from the top portion and stop talking 1 packet before the card.
6. Most spectators will ask you to stop while you cut the next 2 packets.
7. The forced card will either be the top card of the left packet or the right packet. Show it.
8. If the spectator hasn't said anything, show that you have few cards in the left and that they need to be quicker.
9. Repeat the process, cutting the first three packets very quickly while you talk so they can't stop there.

### Vernon substitute transfer

1. N Forced cards on bottom, with pinky break.
2. Spread the deck and ask the spectator to touch N cards.
3. Outjog those cards and square the deck.
4. Rotate the outjogged cards to the left using your right hand.
5. Hold the deck using the right hand in Biddle grip.
6. Separate the bottom cards with the left hand and use it to strip out the outjogged cards on top of it, keeping the break.
7. Touch the deck onto the left hand cards while squaring it, just barely, to steal the previously outjogged cards to the bottom.
8. Your left hand contains the forced cards.

# Color changes

Apparently transforming one card in another.

## Twirl color change (pivot color change)

1. Pick two cards back-to-back with thumb and middle finger on opposite corners.
2. While shaking, use the ring finger and/or index finger to rotate the cards together.
3. Place the two cards on top of deck.
4. Pick up only the top one to hand out for examination.

## Erdnase color change

1. Have the two cards on top of the deck, face up.
2. Cover the top card with your right hand, straight and flat.
3. Outjog the card towards the spectator by moving the deck towards you while the pressure of your fingers keeps the card in place.
4. Outjog the second card towards you using the right hand's thumb pad, pulling it until it clears the first card.
5. Use your left index finger to return the top card flush with the deck while you adjust your left hand so the top card moves as little as possible.
6. Palm the replacement card to reveal the card still on top before you change, or just cover the top immediately by restoring your hand to the original position.

[Video by Alex Boyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEPAj-l_-F4).

# Double lifts

Lifting the top two cards while appearing to just be showing the top card.

Usually has two phases:

1. The *get-ready*: usually catching a pinky break on the top two cards.
2. The *turnover*: the actual turn of the top two cards.


# Vanishes

## Palm vanish

1. Cup your hand over a card.
2. Hold it with the palm, keeping the fingers close together so the card is not visible.
3. Lift the hand, taking the hidden card with it.

## Backpalm vanish

1. Hold the card with the pinky and the index finger, like a spiderman move.
2. Use the middle and ring finger to rotate the card, holding it with the other two fingers.
3. Hide it by holding just a tiny bit with the fingers.

Mask the sleight by moving your hand while you do it.

# Stacking the top during performance

## Culling short stacks

1. While searching for a known selected card, take a few other cards from the deck along with it.
2. Hesitate on the choice, looking at your spectator and deciding if "they are the type who would choose this card".
3. Eventually decide on the selected card, putting the rest on top of the deck.

With some practice, depending on the state of the deck, this maneuver can be used to set the deck in alternating red-black, or at least a good portion of it.

# Flourishes

## Springing the cards

1. Square the deck.
2. Hold the deck in the right hand, with the thumb on the bottom left corner and the middle finger on the top right corner.
3. The fingers should be barely touching the last card.
4. Place the first finger touching the middle finger.
5. Squeeze the deck while relaxing the thumb and let cards shoot out.
6. The left hand should use the pinky and thumb to trap the cards inside roughly squared.
7. Hand distance should increase and then decrease again.

# Other principles

## Multiple outs / I make the rules

Because the magician does not reveal what will happen next, they can change their actions along the way. For instance, if a selected card is 4th from the top, a selected number of 3 or 4 can find it:
- If the chosen number is 3, the magician can say "the next card is your card!".
- If the chosen number is 4, the magician can say "the last card dealt is your card!".

# Stacks

## Si Stebbins

- Very little memorization.
- Colors alternate.

Order:
- Values increment by 3: A-4-7-10-K-3-6-9-Q-2-5-8-J (top to face).
- Suits alternate clubs-hearts-spades-diamonds (**CH**a**S**e**D**).

# Practice routines

## First practice routine

1. Overhand shuffle
2. Double lift
3. Elmsley count


# Tricks

## Detective

From [Matt McGurk's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEqX6sp-iaU) channel.

1. Take out a Queen or a Jack from the deck and say he/she is a detective that will help you find a card chosen by the spectator.
2. While you're explaining this, separate two piles of 15 cards each (pushing groups of 3 or 2 cards at a time to make it seem you're not actually counting).
3. Place the packets in front of one another and ask the spectator to cut each one to the side.
4. Let the spectator choose a card from the unused rest of the deck.
5. The spectator chooses one pile and puts their card face down on top of it.
6. Put either of the packets of the other row on top of it (you can let the spectator choose).
7. Put the Queen/Jack face up on the other packet of this row.
8. Put the fourth packet on top of the Queen/Jack.
9. You're left with two packets, ask the spectator which goes on top of which.
10. The spectator can cut the cards.
11. Deal cards into two piles.
12. Keep the pile containing the face-up Queen/Jack.
13. Repeat steps 10-12 until only two cards remain: the Detective and the chosen card!

The reason it works is that the initial procedure ensures that in the starting pile there are 15 cards between the two cards (the face-up one and the selection). After the first deal, there are then 7 cards between them. After the next deal, there are 3 cards between them. After the next deal, there are four cards left, and the two cards are separated by 1 card. Hence, after the last deal, the two cards will be together in one pile.

It’s a nice progression from 15 to 7 to 3 to 1 - i.e. (n-1)/2.

## In the middle

From [CardMechanic's](https://youtu.be/Klin-FUf0RU?t=896) channel.

1. Ask the spectator to choose a card.
2. Split the deck into two almost exactly equal piles.
3. The spectator puts their card on top of one of the piles.
4. Put the other one on top.
5. Deal deck into 4 different piles.
6. Show each pile to spectator and they choose which one contains their card.
7. Eliminate the rest.
8. Deal that pile again into 4 equal piles.
9. Say that you will eliminate piles now, but without seeing the cards.
10. Eliminate the first pile, with the most cards.
11. From the other piles, take out the middle card of each.
12. Make a new pile with the remaining 3 cards (in the same order).
13. Say that you still have one card in the middle, show that one: it is the spectator's card.

This works because after step 6 the spectator's card is exactly in the middle of the 13-card pile.

## Water and Oil

1. Choose 3 red cards and 3 black cards.
2. Spread them on your hands facing the audience. The black cards should be on the right.
3. While turning them facedown, use your left thumb and right middle finger to switch the middle two cards and separate them into two piles, grabbed by each hand.
4. You will now put cards (alternating from each pile) to the middle, starting with the right pile.
5. You explain that you're putting a black card, then a red, a black, then a red, etc.
6. You can show cards 1, 3, 4, 6 while moving them.
7. You explain that black ink is thicker and thus heavier. By waving the cards, the black cards will fall to the bottom.
8. You show that the top three cards are red and the bottom three are black.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsPap-P06jI


## Power of fours

1. Fan the deck face up while saying they're all in a random order.
2. Peek at the fourth card.
3. Riffle shuffle maintaining top stock.
4. Ask the spectator to cut anywhere.
5. Say that by looking at the fourth card of one of the packs, you'll know what the fourth card in the other pack will be.
6. Name the first peeked card and flip the fourth card of the top pack.
7. Put the bottom pack on top. The trick is now reset and you know which card is in fourth position.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzjhcfVvWRA

## 4-Way prediction

From [CardMechanic's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klin-FUf0RU&t=503) channel.

1. Glimpse the bottom card (e.g. 2 of Clubs).
2. Spread the cards on a table like a casino wash (but remember where the bottom card is).
3. Ask one spectator to feel where the 2 of Clubs is and pick it out.
4. Receive it, glimpse what it is (e.g. 4 of Hearts) and place it face down to the side.
5. Ask the next spectator to feel where the 4 of Hearts is and pick it out.
6. Glimpse it (e.g. 7 of Spades).
7. (Optionally repeat steps 5-6 for a third spectator, or more.)
8. Say now it's your turn, and you'll pick the 7 of Spades out of the wash.
9. Pick the original bottom card (2 of Clubs).
10. Pick up the chosen cards, slide the last one to the bottom and reverse them.
11. You can now reveal the cards in order!

## Back to the Future

Based on Back to The Future (Roberto Giobbi - Card College Light, based on *The spectator does a trick* by Al Leech) and [Decisions by MLT Magic Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXrmygSTowo).

1. Ask the spectator to shuffle.
2. Say that sometimes predictions are not supernatural powers. Sometimes they are just visions from the future. One needs only to transport themselves into the future, see the result of our present actions and come back with that knowledge. Close your eyes for a moment. Open them a few seconds later and say that you have seen exactly the outcome of the next few minutes.
3. Say that you will thus make a prediction using a card in the deck.
4. Look at the cards. Check the value of the first card and suit of the second (or vice versa) and take out a "prediction card" facedown on the table that is the combination of the two. If they are two numbers of the same suit, make the prediction be the sum of the values if possible. If impossible, change the first cards to make it possible (e.g. by hesitating on a prediction or asking for more shuffling).
5. (Optional) Shuffle retaining top two.
6. Ask spectator to deal some cards from the top and stop when they want (between 10 and 20 or so).
7. (Optional) After they have dealt at least 2 cards, say "of course you can deal from the middle or from the bottom as well if you want. Or even shuffle again.".
8. Ask them to deal from that pile into two different piles (alternating). The "selected" cards are now on top of each pile.
9. Ask them to take one pile and deal some cards from it.
10. Reverse it by counting it and saying that we will need the same number of cards from the second pile.
11. Deal the same number of cards from the other pile on top of the previous.
12. Eliminate pairs of cards from the edges of the pile. You can spread them and take from one edge while the spectator takes from the other.
13. Remind the spectator that they shuffled, they dealt, they chose how many cards to deal each time. And yet...
14. The two center cards determine the number and suit of the prediction.


## Manto

By Richard Vollmer, read in Roberto Giobbi - Card College Light.

1. (Setup or peek the first 21 cards of the deck, counting how many red/black.)
2. Write a prediction that says: "There are 21 cards face up. X Are red. Y are black."
3. Use the [Cut And Turn Over](#cut-and-turn-over-cato) principle to apparently shuffle the order and orientation of the cards.
4. Summarize that the deck was shuffled not only by you but also your spectator, with complete freedom to cut and turn over cards. Nevertheless...
5. Reveal the correct prediction and spread the deck, counting the cards and how many are red/black.

## Posi-negative coordination (Card College Lightest)

1. Setup: alternate colors in deck. Alternatively, alternate colors in only one portion and use that portion.
2. Spread the deck irregularly (so some colors seem to repeat) and show that it is "shuffled", saying "values are all mixed" to pull attention towards the values and not the colors.
3. Separate into two halves, the bottom colors must be different.
4. Riffle shuffle the two halves together. Spectator can square them.
5. (Due to the Gilbreath principle, colors either alternate or repeat only once. No group of 3 ever occurs.)
6. Tell the spectator to deal a card face down to the left and another face up to the right.
7. Repeat the previous step until all cards are dealt.
8. During the deal, point out how the face-up pile is naturally random.
9. Say that this step is to build up coordination inside the spectator, between their left side and right side.
10. Have the spectator take the face-up pile and deal red cards to the left and black cards to the right.
11. Say this step is to synchronize your coordination to theirs, and we'll see if they match.
12. Do the same with your face-down cards, when the spectator puts a card to their left you put a card to **_your_** left.
13. Reveal the face-down piles and show that your black cards are underneath the spectator's black cards, and the same for red.
14. The coordination/synchronization was a success!

## Numerology (Card College Lightest)

(Interesting trick to deal a lot of cards face up and stack or memorize cards for other tricks)

1. Have the spectator shuffle the deck.
2. Have the spectator cut about a quarter of the deck (must &le; 19 cards)
3. Ask them to count the cards they have selected, in secret, and store them away.
4. Deal cards from the rest of the deck, face up.
5. The spectator should remember which card landed in the position of their number.
6. Stop at 19th card.
7. Ask "I assume you must have seen your card, yes?".
8. Put the rest of the deck on top.
9. Seen card is 33th (`52 - 19`) from the top (because it's `19 - x` from the bottom and there are `x` cards missing on top).
10. Spectator should repeat 3 times:
    1. Draw a card from the deck face-up into a pile while counting "10".
    2. Draw another on top counting "9".
    3. Repeat until they reach "1".
    4. If any card matches the number they are saying, stop, leaving that card on top. Aces count as 1, court cards can count as 10.
    5. Otherwise, on "0", take the top card from the deck and leave it face-down on top of the pile.
11. Sum the values of the cards in the piles (face-down cards are 0). The spectator's card is at that position in the remainder of the deck!


## Man seeks woman

This trick uses the Ramasee principle, where you reverse one of the piles and loop any of the piles until they match.

1. Grab the 4 Kings and 4 Queens in the same order of suits.
2. "When cards were first introduced, they mirrored society, just like the game of chess. With time, that has been lost, but I'd like to revive it for today. The Kings and Queens will stand for men and women of our times, in search of their match".
3. Place one packet on top of the other.
4. Cut and/or Charlier shuffle. Optionally, Charlier shuffle face up.
5. Deal the top four cards to your left (reversing their order).
6. Show the remaining 4 cards and place them face down on the right.
7. Have the spectator slide a card from the top of either packet to its bottom, 3 times (like typing "man"), or `4x + 3` times (3, 7, 11, ...).
8. (Multiple cards can be moved at once).
9. Point out that if the spectator chose differently, different cards would be on top.
10. Remove the top card of each packet together to the side.
11. Repeat step 6, now 5 times (like typing "seeks"), or `3x + 2` times (2, 5, 8, ...).
12. Remove the top card of each packet together to the side.
13. Repeat step 6, now 5 times (like typing "woman"), or any odd number of times (1, 3, 5, 7, ...).
14. Reveal that the pairs are all matched up!

**Alternate presentation**: since you can use infinite numbers for each slide, you can ask the spectator to guess how many "tinder swipes" each card did before matching. If they hit a good number (e.g. an odd number in the last step), the trick will seem even more impossible. Otherwise, just say you feel like they needed a bit more and add as many cards as you need.


## Mr. King's Tapestry

Story: "Mr. King, a great lover of art, bought a rare tapestry. It had beautiful patterns, looked a little something like this":

Take out the 4 Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens and make a grid with them, face up (R = Random, K = King):

```
R R K K
R R R R
K R R K
R R R R
```

"Mr. King knew the value of the tapestry, so he asked his initial to be woven into it."

Flip some cards face down in a shape of a K, facing your spectators.


```
D U U D
U D U D
U U D D
U D U D
```

"Unfortunately, Mr. King was right to mark it, as it got stolen a few days later. A few suspicious figures broke into Mr. King's home and rolled the tapestry up."

Instruct the spectator to "roll" (flip) any edge on top of the inner row/column, until only a pile remains. This will put the CATO principle into action.

"The thieves sold the tapestry to an antique dealer. One day Mr. King passed by the shop and instantly recognized it. The shop owner asked for proof, of course, and Mr. King was happy to oblige: he rolled the tapestry and four hidden motifs emerged."

Spread the deck, reveal that only 4 cards are face down: they are the Kings!

This trick works with any combination of cards and patterns. To create one yourself, copy the following alternating (CATO) pattern:

```
D U D U
U D U D
D U D U
U D U D
```

Given this original pattern, consider that every position with a card that you want to reveal in the end needs to be flipped. Notice how in the original trick the Kings are placed and flip the 3rd, 4th, 9th and 12th positions.


## Fully Automatic Aces (Card College Lighter)

1. Setup: Ace of Spades, Red Ace, &lt;deck&gt;, Red Ace, Ace of Clubs.
2. Say you will show many different ways to manipulate the deck.
3. False cut / False shuffle.
4. Reveal the top Ace by turning it over.
5. Say that this was evidently sleight of hand, but in this day and age we don't have time for manipulations.
6. Press the top and bottom cards and throw the rest of the deck onto the left hand.
7. The bottom Ace should remain face down in the right hand. Reveal it.
8. Drop the Aces onto the table and hold the deck in dealing position.
9. Deal cards until a spectator calls stop. Reinforce that they could have stopped anywhere.
10. Drop one black Ace on top of the pile you dealt and drop the rest of the deck on it.
11. Repeat the process.
12. Ribbon spread the deck, say you used the spectator and the Aces to find the other Aces!
13. Use the black Aces to turn over the cards on top of them: it's the red Aces!

If the audience is on the other side of the table, ribbon spread the deck from the right to the left, in order to position the face-up cards left of the cards to be revealed (in the audience's perspective). This will reinforce that the reveals are "after" (to the right) the key cards.

## Biddle trick

1. Force a card or use a key card.
2. Spread the deck and choose 5 cards where the second is the chosen card.
3. Place the cards on top of the deck and hold only the top half of the deck (including those cards) in Biddle grip.
4. Show each card one by one, moving them to the left hand.
5. The spectator should reply mentally to each one whether that's their card.
6. Before moving the second card to the left hand, prepare a pinky break.
7. When moving the third card to the left hand, steal the second card to the bottom of the pack, using your right fingers.
8. Place the top half back on the deck.
9. Biddle count or Elmsley count the 4 cards as 5 (facedown).
10. Tell them to hold on to the 5 cards.
11. Their card is still inside the deck, faceup.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTPG1HsvQ2E

Alternative:

Don't use a key card, control the card to second from the bottom (e.g. control to the top and then keep top and bottom cards while overhand shuffling).
You can then make the 5 card selection facedown, which adds to the effect.

## Truth Detector (inspired by Lie Detector of Card College Light)

1. Force a card, e.g.: Glimpse the top card by spreading the deck with the "deck is shuffled line" and use a cross-cut to force the top card.
2. Explain that the voice betrays the sincerity of a person, and by hearing alone you can detect whether someone is lying. Thus you want to conduct an experiment to detect when they are truthful.
3. The spectator is to select another 4 cards and hold them alongside their card.
4. You turn your back to the spectator.
5. The spectator names every card they're holding saying "My card is the &lt;name of the card&gt;".
6. After some theatrics you identify their card saying that their voice was more solid when they said that name.

## Out of Sight, Out of Mind

Originally by Dai Vernon, this is [SpideyHypnosis's handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTy68aZSMvc).

1. Have the spectator shuffle the deck.
2. Explain that you will try to read the spectator's mind to discover a card they are merely thinking of.
3. Show them the top 6 cards of the deck slowly, one by one, and instruct them to think of one.
4. After the sixth card, ask them if they have chosen one. If they have, proceed, otherwise repeat with another six cards.
5. When they say yes, put three of the cards on top of the deck, hold a break, put the other three on top.
6. Double undercut to move the top three cards to the bottom.
7. Say that, most of the time, spectators choose a card and hold it, but this time he/she is merely thinking of one. While you say this, take a card from the middle of the deck and move it to the bottom, to hide the three bottom cards.
8. (Optional) False riffle shuffle retaining top and bottom.
9. Start showing cards from the bottom to "recreate the image of the card in the spectator's mind".
10. Hold those 7 cards with the right hand, keep spreading the deck with the left slowly until around halfpoint.
11. Ask them if they've already seen their card.
    - If so: cut the bottom 7 cards to the top.
    - If not: Run three cards from the bottom to the top (either face up and throw the deck on top or face down, injog and throw the deck on top).
12. Their card is now 4-6th from the top.
13. (Optional) Place the deck on top of the spectator's hands.
14. Start taking cards from the top at an angle, "feeling them", subtly peeking them.
15. After 3 cards, hold a break before you take the 4th.
16. Take the 4th and the 5th over the pinky break, remembering their values.
17. Go to take the 6th but instead say "no, I'm going to stop right here".
18. Ask them to name the card they're thinking of.
    - If it was the 4th: double lift and show it.
    - If it was the 5th: drop the break and show your top card.
    - If it was the 6th: ask the spectator to turn over the next card.
19. If you had to double lift, hold the two turned cards and turn the rest of the packet face up to clear the lift.

Alternative: Always place the 7 seen cards on top regardless. If they say they saw it, it's 4, 5, or 6. If not, it's 8, 9, or 10.

# Gimmicks

## Invisible Deck

The Invisible Deck is a gimmicked deck where the card backs are treated with roughing fluid so they stick together. Half of the deck is therefore facing up (e.g. odd cards plus red Kings) and the other is facing down (e.g. even cards with black Kings).

The usual routine with the invisible deck is:

1. Ask the spectator to imagine he takes an invisible deck.
2. They take the deck out of the box, spread the cards and choose any one.
3. They turn that card face down.
4. They put the deck inside the imagined box and give it/throw it to you.
5. You open the Invisible Deck, spread it and find the pair of the selected card, separate it and show a face-down card.
6. The face-down card is the selected card.

Pairing of the cards:
- All odd cards are facing the same way
- All even cards are facing the same way.
- Spades are paired with Hearts.
- Clubs are paired with Diamonds.
- Each pair sums 13 (Ace = 1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12).
- Kings are paired together.
- Red Kings are on the odd side.
- Black Kings are on the even side.

Alternate pairing: Flip over all the clubs/diamonds pairs.
- Even spades and hearts facing the same way as odd clubs and diamonds.
- King of spades and King of diamonds in the even spades and hearts side.
- King of hearts and King of clubs in the odd spades and hearts side.

Mnemonic for the position of the deck in the box:
- Odd side facing the Ace on the box
- Even side facing the 2 rider drawings (or the 10 of hearts).

Handling tips:
- Press hard when spreading the deck.
- Grab the selected card with the left fingers while spreading its pair with the right thumb.
- To instantly reset, don’t square the deck while showing selection, hold it on one hand while the other shows the selection and returns it in its original position.
- Simplified Craig Petty handling:
  1. Open the deck pair-side up.
  2. Lift selected side towards you.
  3. Just search for the selected card, separate it and outjog it to show its back.
- To break the deck in:
  1. Dribble the cards a few times.
  2. Rub each pair against each other.

### Invisible deck underrated properties

- More tangible presentation: spectator actually reverses card in a different color deck and watches it affect the invisible deck.
- If every card faces the same way, you can reverse some cards in the deck to instantly vanish them.
- If you spread the deck face up, it will hide any facedown cards.
- If you spread the deck face down, it wil show the facedown cards (seemingly appearing out of thin air).
- If you write a forced prediction on the back of every card, you can let the spectator freely select a card and not only is it turned over in the deck, it has the prediction on the back.
- If you write different predictions on the back of each card, you can force a card (e.g. with another deck) and not only is it turned over in the prediction deck, it has the prediction on the back.

### Routines with the Invisible Deck

#### Cards across

From Craig Petty's Visible. Requires two Invisible Decks of the same color.

1. Setup: Separate the rough/smooth cards of one Invisible Deck so they are all face up.
2. Setup: Bottom of the deck are 10 rough/smooth cards face up, 3 rough/smooth face down hidden in between some of them.
   - You can use the final card as your reminder that it's the end of the pile (e.g. a red Queen).
3. Setup: Top of the deck are 3 rough/smooth copies of the hidden cards.
4. Turn the deck face up and count off the apparent 10 cards (with the 3 hiding in between).
5. Give that pack for the spectator to hold.
6. Turn the deck face down and force the top 3 cards (e.g. cross-cut force).
7. Explain that you will make those cards disappear from the deck and appear in the cards held by the spectator.
8. Insert the cards face up in the face down deck and square them.
9. Turn the deck face up and, spreading it, show that there are no face down cards, they vanished.
10. Count the held cards previously in the spectator's hand, separating the rough/smooth pairs and revealing the selected cards.

#### Symbiotic

1. Setup: Separate the rough/smooth cards of one Invisible Deck so they are all face up.
2. Setup: Flip 5 cards face down (e.g. the first 5 Si Stebbins cards) and hide them in the deck.
3. Setup: Prepare regular copies of those 5 cards to be forced in a regular deck (preferably of a different color).
4. Spread the prepared deck face up so the cards remain hidden. Tuck it away and give it for the spectator to hold.
5. Force the 5 cards in the regular deck (e.g. cross-cut force, Vernon substitute transfer).
6. Ask the spectator to deal them onto the table face up.
7. Spread the Invisible Deck face down and the cards appear, (try to match the card order by spreading the deck in the right direction).

#### Do as I do

From Craig Petty's Visible.

1. Present a Si Stebbins or memorized deck to a spectator.
2. Explain you will ask them to make some actions under the table and you will do the same.
3. Ask them to turn the deck face up.
4. Ask them to do any number of simple cuts.
5. Ask them to take the top card and, without looking at it, reverse it and put it in the middle of the deck.
6. Ask them to place the deck on the table (face up).
7. Look at the face up card and determine which card came next in sequence: that is the reversed card.
8. Flip your invisible deck so that the card should be reversed when you show it.
9. Spread through the deck and "find the reversed card".
10. Ask the spectator to spread their deck and find their reversed card.
11. Ask them to reveal it: both cards are the same!

#### Invisible aces

From Craig Petty's Visible, based on "The card that matters" by Rick Lax.

1. Take out the Aces (and pairing Queens) from the invisible deck.
2. Use Equivoque / Magician's Choice to force the Queens:
   1. Picture cards vs number cards
   2. Female cards vs male cards
3. Ask the spectator to choose the suit of the Queen.
4. Reveal the Queen behind the Ace.

#### Idea: Reversed trick

Idea: Join elements from Craig Petty's Across with the presentation of ["Back to the Future" by Pit Hartling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfLpHBe3QV4).

1. Announce you will invert time and do a trick in reverse.
2. You choose a card from the deck and announce "this is your card!", but you reveal it to have no face.
3. "The card has no face yet because you haven't selected it from the deck yet!"
4. Switch it with a forced regular card and place it face down to the side.
5. Force a duplicate with the Invisible Deck.
6. The spectator peeks at the card, puts it face down in the deck.
7. You spread the deck showing the card is gone.
8. The "prediction"/"found" card now has a face. It is the selected card!


# Presentation ideas

- Keep the routines short (3 tricks, 15 minutes altogether)
- For tricks with a small number of cards, consider replacing the cards with pieces of cardboard with other texts (names, emotions, etc). (Roberto Giobbi)
- "May I ask you to help me? You'll get 50% of course. 50% of the applause!" (Roberto Giobbi)
- "I don't want you to think I'm going to cheat. I'm going to cheat, I just don't want you to think that!" (Craig Petty)
- (When the spectator makes a mistake) "Oh no problem, it's absolutely my fault, I shouldn't have picked you." (Craig Petty)
